// What CONSTRUCTED this immutable assertion record. These values say nothing
// about review, approval, adoption, promotion, or lifecycle: Attestation,
// LocalAdoption, and LifecycleEvent own those facts. A changed proposition is
// a new assertion with a new IRI and derivation/supersession links.
//
// `rkaf:deterministicExtraction` distinguishes a mechanically reproducible
// parser or join from `rkaf:imported`, which only says the record was copied
// from another system. See Core §2.4.
#AssertionOrigin: "rkaf:humanAsserted" | "rkaf:aiSuggested" |
	"rkaf:imported" | "rkaf:deterministicExtraction"

// Why the proposition may be believed. This is deliberately independent of
// `rkaf:assertionOrigin`, which records what CONSTRUCTED the record. A model
// may extract a source-explicit statement, a human may record a statistical
// inference, and review changes neither fact. See Core §2.5.
#EpistemicBasis: "rkaf:sourceExplicit" | "rkaf:deterministicDerivation" |
	"rkaf:statisticalInference" | "rkaf:editorialAssertion" |
	"rkaf:userAssertion"

// An unreviewed AI proposal may be retained and discovered, but it may not
// silently cross into drafting, operational, publication, or official use.
// Broader use requires a separate Attestation and, where applicable, a scoped
// LocalAdoption; changing those records never changes the epistemic basis.
#ProvisionalAIUsageEligibility: "rkaf:notEligible" | "rkaf:searchOnly" |
	"rkaf:reviewQueueOnly"

// Whether the proposition is affirmed or denied. Part of the immutable
// proposition core, so it lives beside `#AssertionProposition` rather than in
// one form's file: `#RelationshipAssertion` and `#ValueAssertion` both close
// over the same two values. Predicates stay affirmative; polarity records
// whether the source-backed assertion affirms or denies that relationship.
#AssertionPolarity: "rkaf:affirmed" | "rkaf:denied"

// Immutable proposition content: WHAT is claimed, and whether the claim is
// affirmed or denied (§2.3). Every proposition-bearing assertion form composes
// this definition, so the two forms cannot drift on the shared half of the
// proposition.
//
// This definition deliberately carries NOTHING else. Acceptance, disposition,
// confidence, attestation, and consumer eligibility are separate records keyed
// to the assertion IRI — an assertion's identity never includes mutable state,
// so none of it may live here. `#ConsumerDisposition` below is the named
// counterpart holding the mutable half; keeping both named makes the boundary
// a structural fact of the source rather than a comment.
//
// The object slot is form-specific and therefore NOT declared here:
// `#RelationshipAssertion` supplies an IRI-valued `rkaf:assertsObject`,
// `#ValueAssertion` a typed-literal `rkaf:assertsValue`.

// The envelope holds CONTEXT for a proposition — where it came from, what
