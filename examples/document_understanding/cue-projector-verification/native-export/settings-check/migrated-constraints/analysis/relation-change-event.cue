// RelationChangeEvent (Analysis §2) — a source-stated ADOPTION, REMOVAL,
// SUSPENSION, or REPLACEMENT of a relation.
//
// This is the third of the four cases the analysis module keeps apart, and the
// one most often collapsed into the other three:
//
//   the source affirms the relation      -> affirmed  #RelationshipAssertion
//   the source denies the relation       -> denied    #RelationshipAssertion
//   the source CHANGES the relation      -> #RelationChangeEvent  (here)
//   the source says nothing              -> unknown; no record at all
//
// A change event is NOT a denial. "The Secretary removes the designation"
// does not assert that the designation never held; it says a designation that
// held is being taken away, at some stage of some process, with some intended
// effect time. Recording that as a denied assertion destroys the distinction
// between "this was never true" and "this stopped being true", which is the
// distinction every later comparison depends on.
//
// Polarity is therefore structurally absent here. `#RelationChangeEvent`
// composes `#DurableAssertionEnvelope` (epistemic basis, provenance,
// grounding, consumer disposition)
// and deliberately NOT `#AssertionProposition` (subject, predicate, POLARITY):
// a proposal cannot carry assertion polarity. The compiled carriers are
// open-world, so absence alone is not enforcement; the hand-authored shape
// `rkaf:RelationChangeEventNoPolarityShape` in
// `shapes/rkaf-shapes-analysis.ttl` rejects a change event that carries
// `rkaf:assertionPolarity` anyway.
//
// It is also NOT an `rkaf:LifecycleEvent`. A LifecycleEvent records what
// happened to a RESOURCE — an Artifact, a Warrant, an Assertion — and seeds
// cascade closure over that resource. A change event records what a source
// says about a RELATION between two resources, may be merely proposed, and
// seeds nothing. Publishing one as the other would let a proposed removal
// cascade as if it had already taken effect.

// What the source does to the relation. Four operations, each a different
// evidence situation; they are not degrees of one negative signal.
//
//   rkaf:relationAdoption     the relation is created / recognized
//   rkaf:relationRemoval      the relation is taken away
//   rkaf:relationSuspension   the relation is held in abeyance, not ended
//   rkaf:relationReplacement  the relation's object is exchanged for another
//
// Carrier mapping (`spicy_regs.corpora.relation_exclusion_evaluation_v2`):
// `adopt`, `remove`, `suspend`, `supersede` respectively.

// How far the change has got in whatever process governs it. The stage says
// nothing about legal operativeness — that reading belongs to a profile, per
// the domain-interpretation rule (Analysis §7).
//
// `rkaf:changeStageUnclear` is a first-class value, not a gap: a source that
// states a change without a decidable stage must be recordable as such.
// Dropping the record or guessing a stage both convert uncertainty into a
// claim.
