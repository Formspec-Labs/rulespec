// ResolverProofRecord and ResolverProofIssuer (Analysis §4).
//
// The comparison kernel owns deterministic orchestration and nothing else. It
// does not know how a predicate registry, a database, a document parser, a
// model provider, or a legal profile works. Each of those implements a narrow
// resolver protocol and answers ONE question with `pass`, `fail`, or
// `unknown`, a rationale, and a resolvable proof record.
//
// Three rules govern the vocabulary below, and each of them is the reason a
// field exists:
//
//   1. `fail` is a GATE RESULT, never a negative fact about a source. A failed
//      eligibility gate makes a comparison `rkaf:comparisonNotComparable`; it
//      never becomes a denied assertion.
//   2. `unknown` never becomes `fail`. Absence of a decision is its own value.
//   3. An opaque string is not proof. A proof identifier used in a published
//      result must resolve inside the same immutable generation or through a
//      pinned, reachable external record — which is what
//      `rkaf:proofRecordDigest` and `rkaf:proofInputDigest` make checkable.

// WHICH question a proof answers, one value per active resolver protocol.
//
//   rkaf:predicateCatalogProof  is this canonical relation valid, and do two
//                               assertions describe the same relation?
//   rkaf:assertionStateProof    is this assertion accepted for this consumer,
//                               scope, and evaluation time?
//   rkaf:evidenceBindingProof   does exact evidence in this artifact version
//                               support this assertion occurrence?
//   rkaf:baselineWarrantProof   may this assertion serve as the expected
//                               baseline under an active warrant?
//   rkaf:artifactPairingProof   may these artifact versions be compared for
//                               this purpose?
//   rkaf:scopeComparisonProof   are the temporal, jurisdictional, conditional,
//                               and applicability scopes comparable?
//
//   rkaf:machineAdjudicationProof does a machine-adjudicated verdict over a
//                               sealed, independently-witnessed comparison
//                               question hold for this relation? Composed by
//                               `#MachineAdjudicationProof`
//                               (machine-adjudication.cue); the independence
//                               and complete-support rules the answer must
//                               satisfy are cross-node and therefore live in
//                               `shapes/rkaf-shapes-analysis.ttl`, not here.
//
// The three LONGITUDINAL protocols — version lineage, expected coverage, and
// closure — are deliberately ABSENT. They exist only to support omission
// findings, omission is disabled (see closure-claim.cue), and a contract that
// can mint a closure proof is a contract in which closure is half-enabled.
// They enter this enum by the same deliberate contract change that enables
// `#ClosureClaim`, not before.

// #ResolverProofFields carries every property a resolver decision reports,
// minus the JSON-LD `@type` discriminator — the same split `#AssertionEnvelope`
// uses in assertion.cue, and for the same reason: it lets a narrower shape
// compose these fields under a discriminator of its own without CUE trying to
// unify two different `@type` literals.
//
// A MACHINE-ADJUDICATION PROOF (machine-adjudication.cue,
// `#MachineAdjudicationProof`) is deliberately NOT a second `@type`. Two
// mechanical reasons, not merely style:
//
//   1. `tools/conformance_lib.py::schema_bindings()` binds exactly one
//      compiled schema per `@type` IRI. A second class declaring the same
//      literal `rkaf:ResolverProofRecord` would either fail to compile or
//      silently steal the dispatch from the base proof record for every OTHER
//      proof kind, depending on file sort order.
//   2. A distinct `@type` related by `rdfs:subClassOf` does not help: the
//      SHACL suite's `sh:class` constraint component does not apply RDFS
//      subclass entailment the way `sh:targetClass` does without an
//      explicitly supplied `ont_graph`, and `tools/ci_validate.py` /
//      `tools/validate_negatives.py` never supply one. A subclassed proof
//      would silently fail every `sh:class rkaf:ResolverProofRecord` check on
//      `rkaf:comparisonProofRecord` and `rkaf:findingProofRecord` — exactly
//      the citation slots a machine-adjudication proof MUST be usable from.
//
// So a machine-adjudication proof IS an `rkaf:ResolverProofRecord`, plainly,
// with `rkaf:proofType` narrowed to the literal `rkaf:machineAdjudicationProof`
// and five additional properties the conditional below requires exactly when
// that literal is present. `rkaf:MachineAdjudicationIndependentPairShape` and
// `rkaf:MachineAdjudicationCompleteSupportShape`
// (`shapes/rkaf-shapes-analysis.ttl`) find these proofs the same way: by
// reading `rkaf:proofType`, never by a second `rdf:type`.
