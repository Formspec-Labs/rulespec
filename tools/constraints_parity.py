"""Cross-target constraint parity orchestrator.

For every (constraint, fixture) pair, run the fixture through each compiled
target and assert that the violation classification (PASS / FAIL) is identical
across all targets. Cross-target divergence is a release blocker per source
spec §6.3.

Targets exercised in this MVP:
  - JSON Schema 2020-12 (via Python `jsonschema` package, Draft202012Validator)
  - SHACL Turtle        (via pyshacl 0.31+)

Rust and TypeScript targets compile to equivalent code; their parity is the
codegen's structural property (same enums, same field cardinalities), not a
fixture run. The full SDK-side parity test lands in Layer 5 (Plan 6).

Exit codes:
  0  every fixture × target produced the same classification, all match expected
  1  ≥1 cross-target divergence OR mismatch with expected outcome
  2  setup error
