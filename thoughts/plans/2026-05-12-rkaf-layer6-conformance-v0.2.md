# Layer 6 — Conformance Suite v0.2 Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship the Rulespec Layer 6 conformance suite per source spec §10: a public fixture suite that exercises every Vocabulary class with three fixtures (positive, negative, edge), every constraint with positive + negative, every projector through round-trip + Derive, every registry-resolution path, federation protocol with three fixtures (pull, push, disagreement), ≥5 adversarial fixtures, and ≥3 AI-extraction adversarial fixtures. Implement the four conformance levels L1-L4. Publish self-certification documentation.

**Architecture:** The conformance suite is a single declarative index (`conformance/v0.2/suite.index.json`) plus the union of fixtures already produced by Plans 2-5 (vocabulary, projector, federation) and the new fixtures added here for the §10.1 coverage targets that are not already met. A single Rust binary `rkaf-conformance` runs the suite at any of L1-L4 and emits a structured pass/fail report (JSON + Markdown). Self-certification template lives at `conformance/v0.2/SELF-CERTIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md`. The Bridge Contract Registry (Plan 4) indexes conformance declarations.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 1.79+ (axum-free CLI binary), serde/serde_json, the existing `rkaf` SDK (Plan 6) for the actual operation calls.

## Task 1: Author the §10.1 coverage matrix

**Files:**
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/coverage-targets.md`

The matrix maps every coverage target from source spec §10.1 to a concrete fixture or fixture group, and tracks current coverage status.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the matrix**

```markdown
# Rulespec v0.2 Conformance — Coverage Matrix

This file tracks coverage against source spec §10.1. Every row enumerates a coverage target, the fixtures that satisfy it, and the responsible plan that produced them.

## A. Vocabulary class coverage (≥3 fixtures: positive, negative, edge)

| Class | Positive | Negative | Edge | Plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rkaf:Artifact | artifact-eli-positive, artifact-doi-positive, artifact-cid-positive | artifact-mutable-url-negative (this plan) | artifact-multi-scheme-edge (this plan) | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:SourceFragment | sourcefragment-oa-textquote-positive, sourcefragment-oa-xpath-positive, sourcefragment-aknt-eid-positive, sourcefragment-uslm-section-positive | sourcefragment-no-selector-negative (this plan) | sourcefragment-cross-revision-edge (this plan) | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:EvidenceBinding | evidencebinding-positive, evidencebinding-no-evidence-reason-positive | evidencebinding-missing-negative | evidencebinding-cross-warrant-edge (this plan) | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:Warrant | warrant-legal-positive, warrant-scientific-positive | warrant-family-confusion-negative (Plan 3 AI-extraction adversarial) | warrant-cross-family-transition-positive | Plan 2/3 + this |
| rkaf:ConfidenceRecord | confidencerecord-uncalibrated-positive, confidencerecord-calibrated-positive | confidencerecord-score-theater-negative | confidencerecord-multi-method-edge (this plan) | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:AccessScope | accessscope-public-positive, accessscope-organizationVisible-positive, accessscope-regulatoryRestricted-positive (this plan) | accessscope-leak-negative | accessscope-embargo-expiring-edge (this plan) | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:AILineage | ailineage-positive | ailineage-missing-approver-negative | ailineage-derived-from-multiple-models-edge (this plan) | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:RetentionPolicy | retentionpolicy-positive | retentionpolicy-negative-trigger (this plan) | retentionpolicy-legal-hold-edge (this plan) | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:Workspace | workspace-positive | workspace-untrusted-trustlist-negative (this plan) | — | Plan 2 + this |
| rkaf:Assertion | assertion-positive (this plan) | assertion-ai-touched-without-lineage-negative (this plan) | assertion-cross-jurisdiction-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:Attestation | attestation-positive (this plan) | attestation-by-non-actor-negative (this plan) | attestation-by-org-on-public-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:LocalAdoption | localadoption-positive (this plan) | localadoption-rejected-source-negative (this plan) | localadoption-overrides-cascade-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:Justification | justification-positive (this plan) | justification-no-warrant-negative (this plan) | justification-defeasible-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:LifecycleEvent | lifecycle-positive (this plan) | lifecycle-out-of-order-negative (this plan) | lifecycle-overlapping-events-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:Supersession | supersession-positive (this plan) | supersession-cycle-negative (this plan) | supersession-many-to-many-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:Concept | concept-positive (this plan) | concept-bad-skos-mapping-negative (this plan) | concept-cross-workspace-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:ConceptMapping | conceptmapping-positive (this plan) | conceptmapping-non-skos-relation-negative (this plan) | conceptmapping-cross-trust-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:RegistryDisagreement | registrydisagreement-positive (Plan 4) | registrydisagreement-unresolved-negative (this plan) | registrydisagreement-tri-party-edge (this plan) | Plan 4 + this |
| rkaf:BridgeContract | bridgecontract-positive (this plan) | bridgecontract-stale-negative (this plan) | bridgecontract-cross-version-edge (this plan) | this |
| rkaf:BridgeValidationResult | bridgevalidation-positive (this plan) | bridgevalidation-fail-negative (this plan) | bridgevalidation-warning-edge (this plan) | this |

## B. Constraint coverage (positive + negative per constraint)
Every CUE source under `constraints/core/`, `constraints/adversarial/`, and `constraints/ai-extraction/` has a paired positive and negative fixture. Tracked by `tools/constraints_parity.py` (Plan 3); enforced as a release gate.

## C. Projector coverage (round-trip + Derive on every applicable Vocabulary class)
- JSON Schema, JSON-LD, OpenAPI: round-trip fixtures per Plan 5; Derive fixture per Plan 5.
- Per-class round-trip exercised by walking `compiled/json-schema/*` and feeding sample payloads.

## D. Registry-resolution coverage
Every operation in each `spec/registries/openapi/*.yaml` exercised by the Plan 4 reference instances + `tools/federation_test.py`.

## E. Federation protocol fixtures (≥3: pull, push, disagreement-resolution)
Plan 4's `tools/federation_test.py` covers all five modes; cross-referenced here.

## F. Adversarial fixtures (≥5)
Plan 3 `constraints/adversarial/`: conditional-silent-pass, cross-property-coupling, enum-drift, access-scope-leakage, nested-noevidencereason. Five total; meets §10.1.

## G. AI-extraction adversarial fixtures (≥3)
Plan 3 `constraints/ai-extraction/`: warrant-family-confusion, consent-vs-warrant, confidence-score-without-method. Three total; meets §10.1.

## H. Lifecycle cascade closure (CascadeClosureV1) — required for L3
Fixtures under `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/cascade/`: snap-supersession-chain-positive, cross-jurisdiction-cascade-positive, cascade-cycle-negative.

## I. usageEligibility reducer — required for L3
Fixtures under `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/usage-eligibility/`: reducer-meets-floor-positive, reducer-fails-on-restricted-source-negative, reducer-trust-zone-conflict-negative.

## J. Federation participation — required for L4
Plan 4 `tools/federation_test.py` exercises participation; the conformance binary `rkaf-conformance --level L4` re-runs those tests against the partner's own registry endpoint.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/mikewolfd/Work/formspec-stack/rulespec
mkdir -p conformance/v0.2/{fixtures/{cascade,usage-eligibility},levels}
git add conformance/v0.2/coverage-targets.md
git commit -m "spec(conformance): author §10.1 coverage matrix tracking every coverage target → fixture mapping"
```

## Task 2: Author the missing Vocabulary fixtures (those marked "this plan" in the matrix)

**Files:**
- Create: each fixture listed under `(this plan)` in `coverage-targets.md` Section A.

There are ~40 fixtures to author. Group them by primitive and write iteratively.

- [ ] **Step 1: Author the negative + edge fixtures for `rkaf:Artifact`**

`fixtures/v0.2/artifact-mutable-url-negative.jsonld` — Artifact whose only identifier is a mutable HTTPS URL, no `artifactIdentifierScheme`. Should FAIL.

`fixtures/v0.2/artifact-multi-scheme-edge.jsonld` — Artifact with an ELI URI AND a content-hash; both identifier kinds present. Should PASS (multi-scheme is allowed; the §10.1 "edge" coverage tests the parser's handling of multi-identifier artifacts).

- [ ] **Step 2-N: Repeat for every "this plan" row in the matrix.**

For each, the fixture is a small JSON-LD document that the v0.2 SHACL shapes / compiled JSON Schema either accept (positive / edge) or reject (negative).

- [ ] **Step N+1: Update `tools/vocab_audit.py` to also check the Section A fixtures (extend the term-reference table in `spec/rkaf-vocabulary-v0.2.md`).**

- [ ] **Step N+2: Run the full validator suite**

```bash
cd /Users/mikewolfd/Work/formspec-stack/rulespec
python3 tools/ci_validate.py --mode v02       # positives PASS
python3 tools/validate_negatives.py            # negatives FAIL-AS-EXPECTED
python3 tools/vocab_audit.py                   # 100% coverage
```

Expected: All three exit 0.

- [ ] **Step N+3: Commit**

```bash
git add fixtures/v0.2/ spec/rkaf-vocabulary-v0.2.md
git commit -m "test(conformance): complete §10.1 Section A — every Vocabulary class has positive + negative + edge"
```

## Task 3: Author the cascade closure fixtures (Section H)

**Files:**
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/cascade/snap-supersession-chain-positive.jsonld`
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/cascade/cross-jurisdiction-cascade-positive.jsonld`
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/cascade/cascade-cycle-negative.jsonld`

Cascade closure is `CascadeClosureV1` per Rulespec Core §5 (legacy v0.1 algorithm; reused unchanged in v0.2 — see `spec/rkaf-core-v0.1.md`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Author the chain fixture**

A SourceAuthorityRecord A is superseded by B is superseded by C; each carries a Supersession edge. The cascade closure starting at A MUST include B and C transitively. Fixture asserts the closure result (computable in the conformance runner).

```json
{
  "@context": "https://rulespec.org/context/rkaf-context-v0.2.jsonld",
  "@graph": [
    {"@id": "urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-A", "@type": "rkaf:SourceAuthorityRecord", "rkaf:supersededBy": ["urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-B"]},
    {"@id": "urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-B", "@type": "rkaf:SourceAuthorityRecord", "rkaf:supersededBy": ["urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-C"]},
    {"@id": "urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-C", "@type": "rkaf:SourceAuthorityRecord"}
  ],
  "rkaf:expectedCascadeClosure": {
    "from": "urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-A",
    "members": ["urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-A", "urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-B", "urn:rkaf:fixture:sa-C"]
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Author the cross-jurisdiction fixture**

Two cascade chains in different jurisdictions; closure across both is the union, not the intersection. Fixture asserts cross-jurisdiction membership.

- [ ] **Step 3: Author the cycle negative fixture**

A → B → A — the cascade algorithm MUST terminate (no infinite loop) AND surface the cycle as a `rkaf:CascadeCycle` warning record. Fixture asserts both.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add conformance/v0.2/fixtures/cascade/
git commit -m "test(conformance): cascade closure fixtures (snap chain, cross-jurisdiction, cycle)"
```

## Task 4: Author the usageEligibility reducer fixtures (Section I)

**Files:**
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/usage-eligibility/reducer-meets-floor-positive.jsonld`
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/usage-eligibility/reducer-fails-on-restricted-source-negative.jsonld`
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/usage-eligibility/reducer-trust-zone-conflict-negative.jsonld`

The `usageEligibility` reducer (Rulespec Core v0.1 §3) takes the lattice values across all evidence bindings of an assertion and computes the minimum eligibility. Fixtures exercise:

- **meets-floor-positive**: every binding has eligibility ≥ `automatic`; reducer returns `automatic`.
- **fails-on-restricted-source-negative**: one binding has eligibility = `human-review-required` due to restricted source; reducer returns `human-review-required` even if other bindings are `automatic`. Asserts the meet-not-join semantics.
- **trust-zone-conflict-negative**: bindings reference incompatible trust zones; reducer returns `human-review-required` and emits a `rkaf:TrustZoneConflict` warning.

- [ ] **Step 1-3: Author the three fixtures.**

Each fixture has `rkaf:expectedReducerResult` carrying the expected output for the conformance runner to compare against.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add conformance/v0.2/fixtures/usage-eligibility/
git commit -m "test(conformance): usageEligibility reducer fixtures (meets-floor, restricted-source, trust-zone-conflict)"
```

## Task 5: Author the conformance suite index

**Files:**
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/suite.index.json`

The index enumerates every fixture across the test corpus and tags it with the conformance level(s) it exercises.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the index**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://rulespec.org/jsonschema/v0.2/conformance-suite-index.json",
  "version": "0.2.0-pre.7",
  "corpus_root": ".",
  "entries": [
    { "id": "vocab.artifact-eli-positive",
      "fixture": "fixtures/v0.2/artifact-eli-positive.jsonld",
      "validator": "compiled/json-schema/artifact",
      "expected": "PASS",
      "levels": ["L1", "L2", "L3", "L4"] },
    { "id": "vocab.evidencebinding-missing-negative",
      "fixture": "fixtures/v0.2/evidencebinding-missing-negative.jsonld",
      "validator": "compiled/json-schema/evidence-binding",
      "expected": "FAIL",
      "levels": ["L1", "L2", "L3", "L4"] },
    { "id": "projector.json-schema.round-trip-snap",
      "operation": "projector.round_trip",
      "args": {"target": "json-schema", "fixture": "fixtures/v0.2/projectors/json-schema/round-trip-snap-redetermination.jsonld"},
      "expected": "IDENTITY",
      "levels": ["L2", "L3", "L4"] },
    { "id": "projector.json-schema.derive-studio",
      "operation": "projector.derive",
      "args": {"target": "json-schema", "profile": "profiles/studio/studio-profile-v0.2.cue", "expected_sha256": "${EXPECTED_DERIVE_STUDIO_JS_SHA}"},
      "expected": "SHA_MATCH",
      "levels": ["L2", "L3", "L4"] },
    { "id": "cascade.snap-chain-positive",
      "operation": "cascade.compute_closure",
      "args": {"fixture": "conformance/v0.2/fixtures/cascade/snap-supersession-chain-positive.jsonld"},
      "expected": "MATCHES_EXPECTED_FIELD",
      "levels": ["L3", "L4"] },
    { "id": "usage-eligibility.reducer-meets-floor",
      "operation": "usage_eligibility.reduce",
      "args": {"fixture": "conformance/v0.2/fixtures/usage-eligibility/reducer-meets-floor-positive.jsonld"},
      "expected": "MATCHES_EXPECTED_REDUCER_RESULT",
      "levels": ["L3", "L4"] },
    { "id": "federation.pull-resolution",
      "operation": "federation.pull",
      "args": {"registry": "${RKAF_REGISTRY_SOURCE_AUTHORITY}", "kind": "source-authority", "id": "eu_dir_2016_680_oj"},
      "expected": "RESOLVED",
      "levels": ["L4"] },
    { "id": "federation.disagreement-surfacing",
      "operation": "federation.pull_with_disagreement",
      "args": {"registries": ["${RKAF_REGISTRY_A}", "${RKAF_REGISTRY_B}"]},
      "expected": "EMITS_DISAGREEMENT_RECORD",
      "levels": ["L4"] }
    /* …40+ more entries covering Section A through Section J of coverage-targets.md… */
  ]
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Validate the index against its meta-schema**

Author `compiled/json-schema/conformance-suite-index` from a `constraints/core/conformance-suite-index.cue` (use Plan 3's pipeline). Assert the index parses against it.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add conformance/v0.2/suite.index.json constraints/core/conformance-suite-index.cue
git commit -m "test(conformance): author suite.index.json driving every level/fixture mapping"
```

## Task 6: Author per-level documentation

**Files:**
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/levels/{L1,L2,L3,L4}.md`

Each file describes:
- What the level commits to (per source spec §10.2).
- What entries in `suite.index.json` are required for the level.
- How the conformance binary exercises the level.
- What a partner's self-certification disclosure must include for the level.

- [ ] **Step 1: `L1.md` — Validate**

```markdown
# Conformance Level L1 — Validate

**Scope:** Implementation reads Rulespec overlays and validates them per Layer 2 constraints.

**Required entries from `suite.index.json`:** every entry whose `levels` array includes `"L1"`.

**Exercising the level:**
```bash
rkaf-conformance --level L1 --report ./out/L1-report.json
```

**Self-certification disclosure MUST include:**
- Rulespec version exercised (e.g., `0.2.0-pre.7`)
- Conformance suite index version (matches `suite.index.json` `version` field)
- Public URL to the L1 report
- Implementation language(s) and SDK version(s)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: `L2.md` — Project (L1 + Attach + Extract on ≥1 declared target)**

(analogous structure with L2-specific entries)

- [ ] **Step 3: `L3.md` — Cascade (L2 + lifecycle CascadeClosureV1 + usageEligibility reducer)**

- [ ] **Step 4: `L4.md` — Federation (L3 + registry federation participation)**

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add conformance/v0.2/levels/
git commit -m "spec(conformance): per-level documentation L1-L4"
```

## Task 7: Author the `rkaf-conformance` CLI binary

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/rkaf-conformance/{Cargo.toml,src/{main.rs,runner.rs,report.rs,levels.rs}}`

- [ ] **Step 1: Manifest**

```toml
[package]
name = "rkaf-conformance"
version = { workspace = true }
edition = { workspace = true }
license = { workspace = true }
repository = { workspace = true }
rust-version = { workspace = true }
description = "Rulespec Layer 6 conformance runner — exercises the suite at any of L1-L4 and emits a structured report."

[[bin]]
name = "rkaf-conformance"
path = "src/main.rs"

[dependencies]
rkaf       = { path = "../rkaf" }
serde      = { workspace = true }
serde_json = { workspace = true }
anyhow     = { workspace = true }
clap       = { workspace = true }
tokio      = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: CLI**

```rust
// crates/rkaf-conformance/src/main.rs
use clap::{Parser, ValueEnum};
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "rkaf-conformance",

struct Cli {
    #[arg(long, value_enum)] level: Level,
    #[arg(long, default_value = "conformance/v0.2/suite.index.json")] suite: PathBuf,
    #[arg(long)] report: Option<PathBuf>,
}

#[derive(ValueEnum, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
enum Level { L1, L2, L3, L4 }

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    let suite: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(&std::fs::read_to_string(&cli.suite)?)?;
    let level_str = format!("{:?}", cli.level);
    let entries: Vec<&serde_json::Value> = suite["entries"].as_array().unwrap()
        .iter()
        .filter(|e| e["levels"].as_array().unwrap().iter().any(|l| l.as_str() == Some(&level_str)))
        .collect();
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    for e in &entries {
        results.push(rkaf_conformance::runner::dispatch(e).await);
    }
    let report = rkaf_conformance::report::build(&level_str, &results);
    if let Some(out) = cli.report {
        std::fs::write(&out, serde_json::to_string_pretty(&report)?)?;
        let md = rkaf_conformance::report::to_markdown(&report);
        std::fs::write(out.with_extension("md"), md)?;
    } else {
        println!("{}", serde_json::to_string_pretty(&report)?);
    }
    let pass = results.iter().all(|r| r["pass"].as_bool().unwrap_or(false));
    std::process::exit(if pass { 0 } else { 1 });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Runner module**

```rust
// crates/rkaf-conformance/src/runner.rs
use serde_json::{json, Value};

pub async fn dispatch(entry: &Value) -> Value {
    let id = entry["id"].as_str().unwrap_or("(no id)");
    let op = entry["operation"].as_str().or_else(|| Some("vocabulary.parse_and_validate")).unwrap();
    let res = match op {
        "vocabulary.parse_and_validate" => run_validate(entry).await,
        "projector.round_trip"          => run_round_trip(entry).await,
        "projector.derive"              => run_derive(entry).await,
        "cascade.compute_closure"       => run_cascade(entry).await,

        other => json!({"pass": false, "error": format!("unknown op {other}")}),
    };
    json!({"id": id, "operation": op, "result": res, "pass": res["pass"].as_bool().unwrap_or(false)})
}

async fn run_validate(entry: &Value) -> Value {
    let fixture = entry["fixture"].as_str().unwrap();
    let validator = entry["validator"].as_str().unwrap();
    let body = std::fs::read_to_string(fixture).unwrap();

// run_round_trip / run_derive / run_cascade / run_reducer / run_federation_* implemented similarly
async fn run_round_trip(_e: &Value) -> Value { json!({"pass": true}) }
async fn run_derive(_e: &Value) -> Value { json!({"pass": true}) }
async fn run_cascade(_e: &Value) -> Value { json!({"pass": true}) }

- [ ] **Step 4: Report module**

```rust
// crates/rkaf-conformance/src/report.rs
use serde_json::{json, Value};

pub fn build(level: &str, results: &[Value]) -> Value {
    let total = results.len();
    let passed = results.iter().filter(|r| r["pass"].as_bool().unwrap_or(false)).count();
    json!({
        "rkaf_version": "0.2.0-pre.7",
        "suite_version": "0.2.0-pre.7",
        "conformance_level": level,
        "total": total,
        "passed": passed,
        "failed": total - passed,
        "results": results,
    })
}

pub fn to_markdown(report: &Value) -> String {
    let mut s = String::new();
    s.push_str(&format!("# Rulespec Conformance Report — {}\n\n", report["conformance_level"]));
    s.push_str(&format!("- Rulespec version: `{}`\n", report["rkaf_version"]));
    s.push_str(&format!("- Suite version: `{}`\n", report["suite_version"]));
    s.push_str(&format!("- **{}/{} passed**\n\n", report["passed"], report["total"]));
    s.push_str("## Results\n\n");
    s.push_str("| ID | Operation | Pass |\n|---|---|---|\n");
    for r in report["results"].as_array().unwrap() {
        s.push_str(&format!("| {} | {} | {} |\n",
            r["id"], r["operation"],
            if r["pass"].as_bool().unwrap_or(false) {"✓"} else {"✗"}));
    }
    s
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Build + smoke test**

```bash
cd /Users/mikewolfd/Work/formspec-stack/rulespec/crates
cargo build --release -p rkaf-conformance
cd ..
./crates/target/release/rkaf-conformance --level L1 --report /tmp/L1-report.json
cat /tmp/L1-report.json | head -30
```

Expected: A JSON report with `passed == total` for every L1-tagged entry.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/rkaf-conformance/
git commit -m "feat(conformance): rkaf-conformance CLI runs suite at L1-L4 and emits JSON+markdown reports"
```

## Task 8: Author the self-certification template

**Files:**
- Create: `conformance/v0.2/SELF-CERTIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md`
- Create: `docs/conformance/partner-disclosure-howto.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Template**

```markdown
# Rulespec Self-Certification Template

A partner declaring conformance MUST publish the following YAML at a stable URL and register it with the Bridge Contract Registry (per source spec §10.3).

```yaml
# rkaf-conformance.yaml
partner:
  name:    "<organization name>"
  contact: "<public contact>"
  website: "<organization website>"
  registry_endpoint: "<optional — partner's registry instance URL>"

declaration:
  rkaf_version:           "0.2.0-pre.7"
  adoption_depth:         "D3"             # one of D1/D2/D3/D4/D5
  conformance_level:      "L3"             # one of L1/L2/L3/L4
  fixture_suite_version:  "0.2.0-pre.7"
  test_report_url:        "https://partner.example.org/rkaf-conformance/L3-report.json"

projectors_implemented:
  - target: "json-schema"
    operations: ["attach", "extract", "validate", "derive"]
    carrier_convention_version: "0.2.0"

profile:                                  # required if adoption_depth ≥ D3
  name:                    "Studio profile"
  url:                     "https://rulespec.org/profiles/studio/v0.2"
  base_vocabulary_version: "rkaf-core/0.2.0-pre.7"

anchoring_bindings:                       # optional; per spec §4.6
  - binding_uri:     "urn:rkaf:anchor:trellis/1"
    binding_spec_url: "https://github.com/formspec/trellis/blob/main/spec/rkaf-binding.md"

registry_trust:
  - registry: "https://registry.rulespec.org/"
    scope:    ["source-authority", "concept", "bridge-contract"]
    trust_basis: "reciprocal"

partner_participation:                    # opt-in per source spec §13.5
  voice:                  true
  experience_reporting:   true
  profile_publication:    true
  federation_participation: true
```

## Disclosure obligations
- A partner MUST publish a fresh test report whenever the partner upgrades Rulespec version OR fixture-suite version.
- A partner MUST publish a re-test report within 90 days of a Rulespec release that touches the partner's declared conformance scope.
- False conformance declarations are grounds for removal from the Bridge Contract Registry per source spec §15.4.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Howto**

`docs/conformance/partner-disclosure-howto.md` — step-by-step:
1. Run `rkaf-conformance --level <chosen> --report report.json` against your stack.
2. Author `rkaf-conformance.yaml` from the template.
3. Open a PR against the Bridge Contract Registry's public repo with the YAML and link to the report.
4. Merge after technical review.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add conformance/v0.2/SELF-CERTIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md docs/conformance/partner-disclosure-howto.md
git commit -m "docs(conformance): self-certification template + partner-disclosure howto"
```

## Task 9: Wire into CI

**Files:**
- Modify: `.github/workflows/constraints-parity.yml` (or create `.github/workflows/conformance.yml`)

- [ ] **Step 1: Add a job that runs conformance at every level**

```yaml
- name: Conformance L1
  run: ./crates/target/release/rkaf-conformance --level L1 --report /tmp/L1.json
- name: Conformance L2
  run: ./crates/target/release/rkaf-conformance --level L2 --report /tmp/L2.json
- name: Conformance L3 (cascade + reducer)
  run: ./crates/target/release/rkaf-conformance --level L3 --report /tmp/L3.json
- name: Conformance L4 (federation)
  run: ./crates/target/release/rkaf-conformance --level L4 --report /tmp/L4.json
- name: Upload conformance reports
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with: { name: conformance-reports, path: /tmp/L*.json }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/constraints-parity.yml
git commit -m "ci(rkaf): wire rkaf-conformance L1-L4 into release gate"
```

## Task 10: CHANGELOG entry

**Files:**
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Append v0.2.0-pre.7 entry**

```markdown
## v0.2.0-pre.7 — Layer 6 Conformance Suite

### Added
- `conformance/v0.2/coverage-targets.md` — §10.1 coverage matrix.
- `conformance/v0.2/suite.index.json` — declarative index over every fixture.
- `conformance/v0.2/levels/{L1,L2,L3,L4}.md` — per-level documentation.
- `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/cascade/` — CascadeClosureV1 fixtures (chain, cross-jurisdiction, cycle).
- `conformance/v0.2/fixtures/usage-eligibility/` — usageEligibility reducer fixtures.
- 40+ Vocabulary fixtures completing §10.1 Section A coverage (positive + negative + edge per class).
- `crates/rkaf-conformance/` — CLI binary running the suite at any of L1-L4.
- `conformance/v0.2/SELF-CERTIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md` — partner-facing template.
- `docs/conformance/partner-disclosure-howto.md` — howto.
- CI runs `rkaf-conformance` at all four levels on every push.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs(rkaf): CHANGELOG v0.2.0-pre.7 — Layer 6 Conformance"
```

## Self-review

Rewritten 2026-09-21 to match what actually shipped. The plan's Rust
`rkaf-conformance` binary and `conformance/v0.2/levels/` directory were
replaced by the Python reporter `tools/conformance_report.py`,
`rkaf-runtime-cli` and directory-walking fixture discovery; the shipped
architecture is recorded in TODO.md "Conformance (Layer 6)".

- [x] Coverage targets map to concrete fixtures programmatically:
  `tools/l0_l3_coverage_audit.py` and `tools/l4_coverage_audit.py` enforce
  the §10.1 coverage classes; no hand-maintained matrix file exists.
- [x] Every Vocabulary class has positive/negative/edge fixtures, enforced
  by the coverage audits.
- [x] Every constraint has positive + negative coverage
  (`tools/constraints_parity.py` enforces this).
- [x] Every projector has round-trip + Derive coverage
  (`tools/projector_parity.py`; the Derive gate compares byte-identical
  derive output against committed expected files).
- [x] Adversarial fixtures exist: see `fixtures/adversarial/` and
  `fixtures/ai-extraction/`.
- [x] Cascade closure (`CascadeClosureV1`) and usageEligibility reducer
  fixtures exist for L3.
- [x] Level gates run through `tools/conformance_report.py --level
  {L1,L2,L3,L4}`, not the planned binary; L4 behavior fixtures run through
  `rkaf-runtime-cli` (see `fixtures/behavior/`).
- [x] Self-certification template published
  (`conformance/self-certification.template.yaml`); the partner howto is
  `docs/conformance/partner-disclosure-howto.md`.
- [ ] Federation protocol fixtures (pull, push, disagreement): NOT shipped —
  federation stays gated on Plan 4 (registries), so no L4 federation
  participation is claimed.
- [ ] CI on every push runs only the `constraints-parity` and
  `extraction-schemas` workflows; the four conformance levels run through
  `make test`, not on push.
- [x] CHANGELOG entry: the consolidation landed inside the `v0.2.0-pre.18`
  release (TODO.md records the sequencing decision).
