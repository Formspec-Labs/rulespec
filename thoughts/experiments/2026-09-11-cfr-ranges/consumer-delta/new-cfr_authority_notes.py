"""The publisher's own authority note for a CFR part, asked of a pinned cache.

Every rule in the Unified Agenda names the CFR parts it amends, and the Office
of the Federal Register prints, at the head of each of those parts, the
agency's own statement of the authority under which it was issued. That note is
the same claim the rule's Legal Authority boxes make, written by the same
agency and typeset by a publisher -- **the record carrying its own answer key**,
which is the first of the five cross-cutting findings of the human review of
2026-08-23 (``research/evidence/sample-review-2026-08-23/review.md``). It
settled seven of the ten rows in that review's class A ("unreadable") and
resolved or bounded five of the ten in class E ("section absent"), and the
reviewers asked for it by name in both.

This module is the reader for the cache the silent-misreads campaign left
behind, and nothing more: it says whether a note names a citation, one edit
away from one, or neither. **It repairs nothing.** A verdict is a fact about
the publisher's note beside the filer's text; which of the two is wrong is a
different question, and this module does not answer it.

What the cache is
-----------------
``research/evidence/ecfr-authority-notes-2026-08-24/notes.jsonl``, **8,240
records -- every authority note the CFR publishes**, digest-pinned here
(:data:`NOTES_SHA256`, :data:`NOTES_BYTE_LENGTH`) and re-checked on every load,
the way :mod:`refspec.registry.usc_section_oracle` pins its six tables. Fetched
**2026-08-24**, one request per TITLE rather than one per part: the 49
non-reserved titles' full XML, each at its own ``latest_issue_date`` as
``titles.json`` named it that day, so every document is the edition the
publisher currently serves. Those dates run from 2024-05-17 (title 3, unamended
since 2015) to 2026-08-20 and are **not** the fetch date, which is why
:data:`NOTES_ENDPOINT` states an issue date it cannot fill in; every record
carries the concrete URL it came from and the digest of the document it was cut
from.

The register publishes 9,666 parts; 8,240 state an authority and 1,426 state
none (mostly ``[RESERVED]`` placeholders). Each record carries the part, the
note and source-note TEXT as the publisher wrote them, the request URL, the
fetch date, and the ``raw_sha256``/``raw_bytes`` of the title document it was
cut from, so a re-fetch is checkable byte-for-byte. Nothing was truncated:
``raw_truncated_at_128k`` is false on all 8,240 rows, where the 287-record
generation 1 flagged 211 responses captured to a 128 KB head. The raw XML is
**not** retained -- 810 MB -- and the fetch, the extractor and the validation
are in that directory's README.

**Generation 1 is still committed and untouched** at
``research/evidence/silent-misreads-2026-08-22/ecfr-authority-notes.jsonl``:
287 parts chosen by greedy set-cover over the agenda-to-CFR mapping. All 287
are here, 278 byte-identical and 9 differing in a single character reference
apiece -- the ``?part=`` view escapes non-ASCII and the full-title view emits
UTF-8 -- and **no note's words changed between the two dates**. Two of the nine
were fetched at the same issue date on both sides and still differ, which
settles that the cause is the API view rather than the passage of time.
:func:`note_body` reads all nine identically, so nothing a row already carried
moved because of the encoding; the 21,882 verdicts that did move at the switch
are the coverage effect described below, and none of them is one of these.

**80 of the 8,240 parts state no authority at part level and do state one under
their first subdivision**, and this reader takes that note as the part's
witness -- deliberately, and for continuity: generation 1 read a per-part
response top-down and took the first ``<AUTH>`` it met, so 20 CFR 404 and 416
and 5 CFR 550, three of the most-cited parts in the corpus, were already being
judged against a Subpart A note. Dropping them would have deleted verdicts
rather than added any. What changes is that the arrangement is now stated
rather than implied: :attr:`AuthorityNote.authority_level` is ``"part"`` or
``"subdivision"`` and :attr:`AuthorityNote.authority_scope` names the
subdivision, so a consumer who wants only part-level authority can tell the two
apart, and ``cfr_note_part`` naming "20 CFR 404" can be traced to the note that
actually said it. An ``<AUTH>`` under a LATER subdivision is not the part's
note and is not read here at all.

Coverage: the corpus names 8,652 distinct parts on this reader's own join key
and the cache holds **5,793 of them (67.0%), carrying 384,451 of the 420,622
CFR-reference rows (91.4%)**. The 2,859 misses are almost all time rather than
gap -- 1,926 parts no longer exist at the current date, 645 fall inside a
published reserved block, 228 are published ``[RESERVED]`` -- and they skew
old: 72.0% of their rows come from Agenda publications before 2010, against
54.7% of the covered ones. Measured on the pinned Agenda build, that is
**713,547 of 799,126 authority rows covered and 668,894 judged, over 40,613
RINs**, where the 287 parts covered 489,969 and judged 460,887 over 22,788.

**Widening the cache moved verdicts that rows already carried, and that is a
property of :meth:`CfrAuthorityNotes.judge` rather than of the notes.** The
verdict is the best one ANY of the rule's own held parts gives, because a rule
amending four parts is authorised by all four notes together -- so an absence
recorded against the one part the set-cover happened to reach can be settled by
a sibling part it did not. At the switch that moved 21,882 already-judged rows,
every one of them upward (11,287 absent to present, 8,091 near-miss to present,
2,504 absent to near-miss) with no downgrade and no return to NULL, plus 38,913
rows that keep their verdict and name a different part because the part an
absence names is the first HELD part in citation order. No note said anything
new: asking each of the 287 generation-1 parts' own note the 16,373
(part, citation) questions the corpus puts to it gives the identical verdict
under both generations, 0 disagreements.

The gap the switch closes is best read on the campaign's own opening specimen:
**45 CFR 12a, whose entire note is** *"42 U.S.C. 11411; 40 U.S.C. 550."*, was a
tiny part the top-300 set-cover never reached and was fetched by hand; it is
now held, and
``test_the_cache_now_holds_the_part_that_settled_the_opening_specimen`` reads
that note rather than pinning its absence.

The extractor was written independently of :mod:`citation_grammar` on purpose,
so the oracle shares no code with the thing under test. **This reader is the
other side of that arrangement and deliberately does not repeat it**: the
question here is "does the note name what the filer named", and the two sides
of that comparison have to be spelled by one grammar or the comparison is
between two spellings rather than between two claims. So a note is read with
:func:`refspec.registry.citation_grammar.parse_authority_citation`, exactly as
a filer's box is, and the note text stays in :attr:`AuthorityNote.authority_note`
for a consumer who disagrees with the reading.

The three verdicts, and what the survey measured each to be worth
----------------------------------------------------------------
``present``
    The note names the citation. Identity is compared, not spelling:
    ``40:550`` is the pair (title, section) with the section normalized the
    way the section oracle normalizes it. A note **range** covers the sections
    between its endpoints -- 10 CFR 430 says "42 U.S.C. 6291-6309" and a rule
    citing 42 U.S.C. 6295 is named by it -- because that is the note's own
    claim about its own span. ``et seq.`` is **not** a range and is never read
    as one: "49 U.S.C. 60101 et. seq." names 60101, so 49 U.S.C. 60137 is
    absent from 49 CFR 192's note as the publisher writes it today, which is
    the honest answer and not the one a reader hoping to confirm review A's
    specimen would prefer.

``near-miss``
    The note names a citation of the same family **one edit away**, where an
    edit is one insertion, deletion, substitution or transposition of a single
    character (:func:`citation_grammar.damerau_levenshtein` = 1) in the
    canonical identity. The identity is spelled title-and-section
    (``17:12a``), so a wrong TITLE beside a right section is one edit too --
    the mechanism behind the campaign's ``17 USC 12a`` specimen, which 17 CFR
    part 1's note settles as **7** U.S.C. 12a.

    **It is nearly worthless on its own, and that is worth knowing.** The
    campaign adjudicated 31 random near-miss texts (428 rows) and measured
    precision **12.9% by text, 5.6% by rows**: the bucket is dominated by
    agencies legitimately citing a real neighbouring section. What made it
    sharp was conjunction with an independent impossible-referent oracle --
    Table III absence plus a not-found at OLRC -- which took 4,455 rows to
    100% precision on 44 adjudicated texts. This module publishes the loose
    verdict because the conjunction is a consumer's join (the section oracle's
    columns sit in the same table), and it says here, once, that the loose
    verdict alone accuses nobody.

``absent``
    Neither. **Absent from the note as fetched on 2026-08-24** -- never
    "wrong": a note is a living document and the corpus runs from 1995. 49 CFR
    192's note enumerated §§ 60102-60137 when RIN 2137-AE60 cited them in 2010
    and reads "60101 et. seq." today; both are the publisher's text, eight
    years apart. An ``absent`` here is a question, and the era caveat is
    attached to the class rather than to the row because it is a property of
    every row in it.

What is judged, and what is not
-------------------------------
Four families, named in :data:`FAMILIES`: the U.S.C. title and section, the
Public Law, the CFR title and part, and the act NAME for an act-relative row
(resolved key, or the name as stated where nothing resolved it). They are the
four the review's evidence rests on. Executive orders, Statutes-at-Large
pages, chapters and the rest are left unjudged rather than half-judged: an EO
number has no impossible-referent oracle behind it (every in-range number
names a real order), and the campaign says so explicitly. The builder counts
the rows it leaves unjudged, by type, so the population stays visible.

    split on. So an undecoded entity splits a segment down the middle, and the
    title carry below then reads the tail as a section list.

    is **``&amp;`` six times over six notes**, plus one ``&gt;`` in a source
    note. Generation 1 spelled the section sign ``&#xA7;`` and the em dash
    ``&#x2014;``, 19 and 4 occurrences over 9 of its 287 notes, and decoding is
    what makes those nine read identically across the two generations.

    **Decoding changes what the grammar reads, in both directions, and the

    * 19 CFR part 4 (generation 1) writes "Pub. L. 108-7, Division B, Title
      II,&#xA7; 211", which segments into a bare "211" and the carry reads as
      46 U.S.C. 211. Decoding **deletes that phantom**, which is the whole
      reason this function exists.
    * 36 CFR 59 writes "Sec. 6, L&amp;WCF Act of 1965", which reads as the act
      named "wcf act of 1965" undecoded and "l&wcf act of 1965" decoded.
      Decoding is right: the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act is not the
      WCF Act.
    * 36 CFR 230's whole note is "16 U.S.C. 2103(d) &amp; 2109(e)." Undecoded
      it splits into "…2103(d) &amp" and "2109(e).", and the carry supplies
      title 16 to the tail. Decoded it is one segment, and the grammar does not
      continue a section list across "&" -- so **decoding LOSES 16 U.S.C.
      2109**. That costs exactly **2 rows**: the corpus cites 16 U.S.C. 2109
      twice, both under rules that name 36 CFR 230, both written by the filer
      as "16 U.S.C. 2103(d) and 2109(e)" -- the same list the note writes with
      an ampersand -- and both read ``near-miss`` against a note that names it
      in plain sight. Recorded, not repaired: the fix belongs in the grammar's

    ``16 U.S.C. 1361-1407; 1531-1544`` reads one -- so the separator the
    publisher happened to choose decided whether the Endangered Species Act
    was in its own part's note. It was not: **8,126 rows** citing 16 U.S.C.
    1531 read "absent" against a note that lists it in plain sight, and they
    were the largest single block in that bucket.

    So the title is supplied and the GRAMMAR does the reading -- the same
    shape the builder's own titleless-U.S.C. corroboration takes. The guard is

    89-564; 89-670; 91-605; and 93-87.": the elided label is **Pub. L.** and
    not a U.S.C. title, so the carry reads three Public Law numbers as section
    ranges of title 5, two of which (89-670 and 91-605) are ordered and
    therefore SPAN. Neither costs anything in this corpus -- no row cites 8
    U.S.C. 2651a, and the 92 rows on the two RINs that name 32 CFR 634 cite 5
    U.S.C. 2951, which is outside both spans -- and both are pinned by

    122 right ones would need to know that a hyphenated pair after a Pub. L.
    segment is a law and not a range, which is a Code roster and a label
    memory this reader does not have; this unit widened the notes and not the
    predicate, and the candidate is recorded here rather than half-fixed.

    **And the guard's own cost, measured**: the same note's "1185 note (Section
    7209 of Pub. L. 108-458, as amended by Section 546 of Pub. L. 109-295)"
    carries a parenthetical, so it is not a section list and the title does not
    carry into it -- and the **30 rows** whose filers write "8 USC 1185 note"
    read ``near-miss`` against a note that names exactly that. Widening the
    guard to admit a parenthetical would admit prose, and prose under a
    supplied title is how a note citation gets invented; 30 rows of false lead
    is the cheaper error, and it is stated rather than absorbed.

    1608" published 12 U.S.C. 1608, the Act's own pinpoint page, not a
    section (12 CFR 615's own note, one of 129 notes / 403 marked citations
    measured 2026-09-01). It cannot decide which are real -- 14 CFR 121's
    note is the identical shape and genuinely resumes 49 U.S.C. 44101,
    44701-44702, ... after "126 Stat. 89" -- so it marks rather than refuses,
    and THIS is where the mark is spent: a marked citation is offered only
    when ``oracle.section_is_enumerated`` says so -- the EXACT-list check
    (:meth:`UscSectionOracle.section_is_enumerated`), not the broader
    :meth:`UscSectionOracle.section_exists`, which also affirms a bare
    printed RANGE stub and admitted every one of 12 CFR 615's own fabricated
    pages ("993" among them) on that softer evidence alone, measured before
    this method settled on the stricter one. ``oracle=None`` (no caller
    supplied one, and :meth:`CfrAuthorityNotes.from_file` found no sealed
    oracle directory in the tree the notes cache lives in) withholds every
    marked citation -- refusing rather than reintroducing the fabrication
    silently. A DRIFTED oracle is a different fact and is not degraded to
    this one: see :func:`_oracle_for_root`.

    The gate is not perfect and is not claimed to be, even at the stricter
    check: 8 CFR 281's own note carries "Public Law 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135
    (6 U.S.C. 101 et seq.); 66 Stat. 173, 195, 197, 201, 203, 212, 219,
    221-223, 226, 227, 230" -- the Immigration and Nationality Act's own
    page list, misattributed to title 6 because "6 U.S.C. 101" is the
    nearest anchor a comma-list this reader has always walked from (a
    PRE-EXISTING property of how a title governs a list, not something this
    gate introduces or can fix within its own scope). "197", "219", "227"
    and "230" are refused (title 6 has no such sections); "195", "201",
    "203", "212" and "226" are each, coincidentally, real title-6 sections
    (the Homeland Security Act's own numbering happens to fill that range)
    and are admitted. Measured 2026-09-01: of 403 marked citations, 266 are
    refused and roughly 111 admitted that a no-oracle default would have
    withheld; a manual digit-length pass over the admitted set found this
    same misattributed-title shape behind most of the short (1-3 digit)
    survivors, concentrated in a handful of long, multi-Act notes (17 CFR
    240 and 249 among them). This is the same shape of imperfection B8's
