"""Visible-text extraction: markup in, one searchable Unicode representation out.

`docs/decisions/0001-document-release-2-0.md` requires a `document-body`'s
`representation` to be `text/plain; charset=utf-8` -- "Markup is not search text:
this is visible text extracted before segmentation"
(`documents.schema.json`, `$defs/representation`). The five extractors in
`processing/extraction.py` cannot supply that: every one of them is a
**source-native passthrough** whose representation blob IS the captured file
(`_passthrough_result`), which is the right answer for a store that keeps exact
source bytes and the wrong one for a search corpus. This module is the missing
half, and it does not replace them: an XML file still has a source-native
representation, and now it also has a visible-text one.

Two parsers, both standard library
----------------------------------
* XML through `xml.parsers.expat`, chosen over `ElementTree` for one reason:
  expat reports `CurrentByteIndex`, so every run of character data carries the
  exact byte range of the captured rendition it came from. Evidence that names
  real bytes is the whole point of `rendition-utf8-byte`.
* HTML through `html.parser.HTMLParser`, whose `getpos()` gives the same fact in
  line/column form. Character references are folded by the parser
  (`convert_charrefs=True`), so the emitted text is what a reader sees while the
  recorded range still spans the `&amp;` that produced it.

Neither parser is asked to understand a vocabulary. A **block** is any element
that directly owns non-whitespace character data, found top-down: an element
whose own text is only whitespace is a container and is descended into, and an
element that owns text is emitted whole, inline children included. That rule
needs no tag list and produced clean blocks on every document of the pinned
corpus. The one vocabulary this module does declare is which tags are headings,
and it is declared in the extractor's configuration so it rides inside the
`extractorDigest` the release carries.

Two layout modes, and why
-------------------------
`processing/bounded_segmentation.py` tiles a representation into regions at
blank lines and treats a lone ATX line as a heading. So the layout this module
writes is the segmenter's input contract:

* **normalized** (XML): each block's whitespace collapses to single spaces and
  the block becomes one line, headings prefixed `#` by level. Structure the
  markup carried becomes structure the segmenter can see.
* **verbatim** (HTML): character data is copied unchanged. The pinned corpus's
  HTML is a `<pre>` block holding a Federal Register document whose paragraphs
  are already separated by blank lines; normalizing it would erase every one of
  them and leave one region for the token budget to chop blindly.

Every byte written that did not come from the source -- a separator, a `#`
prefix, a collapsed space -- belongs to no run, and `rendition_range` maps a
representation interval back through the runs that do. A segment therefore
cites the captured bytes it was extracted from and never a byte it invented.
