"""The minting layer: shapes in, one canonical ``urn:rkaf`` identifier out.

:mod:`refspec.registry.identifier_shapes` names the hole this module fills:
*"IRI minting (``urn:rkaf:...``) stays with consumers until the minting layer
is its own port."* No consumer ever did it. Before this module the whole
platform minted exactly one family — ``act_resolution.canonical_usc_iri``,
``urn:rkaf:us:usc:...`` — while the shapes for six others sat validated and
nameless in :mod:`identifier_shapes` and :mod:`citation_grammar`.

A grammar is not a minter. rulespec owns the ``urn:rkaf`` grammar
normatively; what belongs here is the executable step from a validated shape
to the one identifier that shape names, and the refusal of everything else.

The three rules this module is
-----------------------------

- **The shape layer decides, this layer spells.** Every minter below wraps a
  validator that already exists — :func:`~identifier_shapes.normalize_rin`,
  :func:`~identifier_shapes.normalize_docket_reference`,
  :func:`~identifier_shapes.is_federal_register_document_number`,
  :func:`~identifier_shapes.detect_identifier_shapes`,
  :data:`~citation_grammar.CFR_TITLE_COUNT` — and adds no second opinion
  about what a real identifier looks like. Where a minter is narrower than
  the validator it wraps, the narrowing is rulespec's lexical space and is
  named at the site.

- **The candidate is minted and then checked against the contract.** The
  seven lexical spaces in :data:`IDENTIFIER_SPACES` are restated **verbatim**
  from the compiled rulespec profiles this repository vendors, the way
  ``act_resolution._RKAF_USC_IRI`` restates the U.S.C. one, and
  ``test_the_minted_spaces_are_the_contract_verbatim`` holds the copies true
  against the vendored package. So what a minter will emit is exactly what
  rulespec's own validators accept — there is no paraphrase to drift.

- **Refusal is ``None``; a broken invariant raises.** A value that states no
  identifier is a measured population, not an error: 39.2% of the pinned
  Federal Register ``document_number`` column takes a shape rulespec cannot
  spell, and an exception per row is not what that is. So every minter is a
  total function returning ``MintedIdentifier | None``. ``ValueError`` is
  reserved for :class:`MintedIdentifier` itself, which refuses to exist
  outside a declared scheme's space — the convention
  ``usc_section_oracle`` uses for its verdicts. The one existing minter
  raises instead, and both of its call sites
  (``act_resolution.py:749,772``) catch the exception immediately and turn it
  back into a refusal; this module keeps the raise where it means something
  and hands out the refusal.

Two readers, and the one place the column is the license
--------------------------------------------------------
:mod:`identifier_shapes` splits its readers in two — the **prose reader**,
handed running text, whose grammar is deliberately narrow, and the **column
reader**, handed a field whose name already declares what it holds. Minting
inherits that split at exactly one place:
:func:`mint_federal_register_document_iri` takes ``column_licensed``, and only
that flag admits :data:`BARE_LEGACY_FEDERAL_REGISTER_DOCUMENT_NUMBER`. Prose
detection is not loosened by a single character, because nothing here is
asking it to be.

The docket minter inherits the other half of the same doctrine and it is
easier to misread: it wraps a COLUMN reader, so it mints what a
``docket_ids_json`` value states, including a Regulations.gov document id that
fits the docket shape. See :func:`mint_regulations_gov_docket_iri`.

What rkaf cannot spell today, measured
--------------------------------------
Every number below was measured 2026-08-31 against the same two pinned
columns :mod:`identifier_shapes` and its tests read — the Federal Register
corpus's ``document_number`` (1,004,233 distinct, in
``spicy-regs/output/rulespec-stabilization-candidate-final/
federal_register.parquet``) and the Unified Agenda's ``rin`` (46,547
distinct). Mostly they are recorded here because a lexical space that cannot
spell a real thing is **a gap in rkaf, ours to fix**, never a fact about the
thing — the posture ``act_resolution`` takes with statutory notes and section
ranges. The RIN entry is the exception that proves the rule has a direction,
and it is the last one below.

Two of these gaps closed in rulespec ``0.2.0rc16`` (REF-054), which is why
this section reads shorter than it did.

- **CLOSED: the Federal Register document space was five digits wide and the
  series is not.** ``rkaf:us-frdoc`` is now ``[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3,5}``, and the
  **28,862** modern-form numbers refused for a three- or four-digit tail —
  2,599 with three, 26,263 with four, all of them published 2010-2013 — are
  first-class. 2010-5997, 2011-237 and 2012-00019 are three of them, each
  confirmed against the publisher's own API on 2026-08-22. First-class
  coverage went **451,704 → 480,566** of 1,004,233, 45.0% → **47.9%**.
- **STILL OPEN, and deliberately: 286 modern numbers below the floor.**
  ``2010-99`` and ``2010-100`` are consecutive documents of one unpadded
  series, and the space admits the second and refuses the first. The floor
  holds at three digits because that makes ``rkaf:us-frdoc`` exactly
  co-extensive with ``identifier_shapes.FEDERAL_REGISTER_DOCUMENT_NUMBER``
  (``\\d{4}-\\d{3,5}``), so the space caught up to the shape layer rather than
  overtaking it. That is a **consistency** argument, not an evidential one;
  the count is written down so a future floor decision has it, the way the
  1,370 ``\\d{2}-\\d{1,2}`` values are written down at
  :data:`BARE_LEGACY_FEDERAL_REGISTER_DOCUMENT_NUMBER`.
- **STILL OPEN as a gap in rkaf, CLOSED as an identity gap: 394,128 (39.2%)
  are the bare-legacy form.** No rulespec space reaches them — that has not
  changed — but as of this cycle (REF-052) the shape moved home to
  ``identifier_shapes.BARE_LEGACY_FEDERAL_REGISTER_DOCUMENT_NUMBER`` and
  reads through that module's own ``column_licensed`` flag rather than a
  local copy here. Every one of these documents still identifies, through
  the partner hatch; only ``rkaf:us-frdoc`` itself is the gap.
- **CLOSED: the letter-opening family's identical short-tail hole, and three
  siblings with it.** REF-052/REF-054 named four letter-opening families
  with a verified live example and 10,340 unread values between them;
  ``identifier_shapes``'s column reader now reads **10,231** of them —
  **5,829** three-digit-and-shorter tails (the short-tail hole this bullet
  used to leave open), **4,195** two-digit prefixes, **206** six-digit tails,
  and the single legacy-prefix-over-modern-body hybrid. The remaining 109
  stay refused, deliberately: 99 short-tail corrections (96 of them naming an
  original document the widening above just made first-class), 9
  colophon-fused values, and 1 non-identifier extraction artifact — see
  ``identifier_shapes._FR_COLUMN_LETTER_FORMS`` for the measurement and the
  publisher pages each family was read against. None of this is a gap in
  rkaf: every value here was always outside ``rkaf:us-frdoc``'s space and
  stays outside it, identified through the partner hatch rather than
  first-class.
- **CLOSED for letters, REFUSED for hyphens: the CFR part.** ``rkaf:us-cfr``
  now writes the part as ``[0-9]+([a-z]|-[0-9]+)?``, covering all 272 of the
  8,424 parts in the OFR's published subject index that are not plain digits
  (``citation_grammar.CFR_LETTERED_PART_SHARE``, which stays ``(272, 8424)``
  — only its consequence changed). :func:`mint_cfr_iri` mints the **83**
  single-letter parts and refuses the **189** hyphen-numbered ones, a
  narrowing against the space that :func:`_cfr_part` states and justifies.
  It spells **8,226 of the 8,424** pairs end to end (97.65%) — the 189 plus
  nine index rows whose part is literally ``0``, which there is no part 0 to
  name.
- **The RIN space is narrower than the query shape.** ``rkaf:us-rin`` closes
  on ``[0-9]{2}`` where ``identifier_shapes._RIN`` allows
  ``[A-Za-z0-9]{2}``. None of the 46,547 Unified Agenda RINs measured on
  2026-08-31 took the divergent form. REF-054 therefore retained the space;
  this is a bounded representation choice, not a universal publisher grammar.
  The cited Fish and Wildlife Service format statement describes that agency.
  ``citation_grammar._RIN_TOKEN`` is a U.S.C. list-parsing guard, not a public
  RIN reader. Minting checks the supported syntax without consulting a roster
  or establishing that a value was issued. The refusal test pins that behavior;
  new roster coverage requires a separate comparison.

The whole ``document_number`` column, sorted by what it can carry and pinned
by ``test_the_document_number_column_is_accounted_for_exactly``: **480,566**
first-class, **521,651** under the partner hatch (394,128 bare-legacy +
127,523 letter-opening), **2,016** refused. 99.8% identified, against 47.9%
if only rkaf's own spaces are minted into and 0% before this module existed.
The census had a fifth bucket for the 28,862 modern short tails; the widening
emptied it, so it is gone rather than pinned at zero. This cycle (REF-052)
moved **10,231** values from refused into the letter-opening bucket
(117,292 → 127,523) without moving a single value into or out of first-class
— the four families it admits are column-licensed, not rulespec-widened, so
the split between first-class and partner-hatch is untouched.

Anything the space cannot spell is still identified, never dropped: it takes
rulespec's own ``rkaf:partner-defined`` escape hatch under
:func:`mint_partner_iri`, whose segment layout is copied from rulespec's own
fixtures (``urn:rkaf:partner:fixture:proceeding:EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0317`` in
``artifact-us-frdoc-positive.jsonld``) with this repository as the partner.

    single-letter forms and REFUSES the hyphen-number form. The narrowing is
    the same kind :func:`mint_cfr_iri` already makes against the title, and it
    is named here rather than left to be discovered.

    **The letter branch.** ``[a-z]`` was 83 of the OFR index's 272 non-numeric
    parts, and it has a live producer: ``parse_cfr_citations("7 CFR 15a")``
    returns part ``15a`` today. Four parts are published UPPERCASE — 26 CFR
    16A, 29 CFR 4022B, 29 CFR 4041A, 46 CFR 147A — and the prose reader emits
    the uppercase spelling verbatim, so folding here is the only thing that
    makes them mintable. The fold is lossless: no part collides with another
    under it anywhere in the index, and each of those four titles also has the
    bare numeric part (26 CFR 16, 29 CFR 4022, ...), which is why the rule is
    to fold and never to truncate.

    **The hyphen branch, refused.** The other 189 non-numeric parts are
    hyphen-numbered (41 CFR 101-1), and every single one is in title 41. This
    layer cannot produce one and must not pretend to:
    ``citation_grammar._CFR_PART_CAPTURE`` stops at the hyphen, which is the
    RIGHT answer in 48 of the 49 titles, because a hyphen after a part number
    usually means a range (40 CFR 60-63), a section written loosely (28 CFR
    23-4 for §23.4) or a numbered standard (49 CFR 571-108) — none of them a
    part. Title 41 is the sole exception, and separating it from the other
    three readings needs a title-conditional rule that does not exist.

    DEFERRED, not fixed: because the capture stops at the hyphen,
    ``parse_cfr_citations("41 CFR 101-1")`` yields part ``101`` and this
    function mints ``urn:rkaf:us:cfr:41:101`` — a first-class identifier for a
    part that does not exist, since none of title 41's 16 hyphen heads is a
    part in its own right. Minting the hyphen form here would replace that
    named, tested gap with a silent wrong answer, so the space carries the
    form and the minter does not. The fix belongs in ``_CFR_PART_CAPTURE``,
    inside receipt-pinned ``citation_grammar``; see REF-054 for the trigger
    that reopens it.

    Unlike titles, parts can be zero: the publisher XML includes 16 CFR part 0

    Three outcomes, and which one a value gets is the news:

    - ``rkaf:us-frdoc`` when rulespec's space can spell it —
      ``[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3,5}``, which is **480,566 of the 1,004,233** distinct
      values in the pinned column (47.9%);
    - ``rkaf:us-frdoc-legacy`` when the value is a pre-2010 bare-legacy number
      AND the caller states its ``publication_date``. This space is
      DATE-QUALIFIED by construction, and that is rulespec's design rather
      than a convenience: the bare number does not identify a document, since
      "00-111" names two of them, and the corpus reported zero collisions only
      because it had already dropped one. So the date is part of the identity,
      not metadata beside it — which is why this outcome is unreachable
      without one, and why the same value with no date still takes the hatch
      below rather than minting a half-qualified identity. **394,128** values
      (39.2% of the column) can reach it. New with rulespec 0.2.0rc17; see
      REF-064;
    - ``rkaf:us-frdoc-x`` when the value is an X-family number, with or without
      a date, because that form carries its own: read right-anchored the last
      four digits are the month and day, and they agree with the publication
      date on **4,400 of 4,400** corpus rows. Stating a date is therefore
      optional and stating a WRONG one raises, which is a property the legacy
      space cannot have. New with rulespec 0.2.0rc18; see REF-065;
    - ``rkaf:partner-defined`` when the shape layer recognises the value and
      rulespec cannot spell it. It is reached through the prose reader by the
      correction and republication forms, by a legacy number nobody dated, and
      — behind ``column_licensed`` — by the letter-opening families that still
      have no space (E, C, R and Z:
      :data:`~identifier_shapes._FR_COLUMN_LETTER_FORMS`). Three populations
      have LEFT the hatch: the 28,862 modern-form numbers with a three- or
      four-digit tail (2010-5997, 2011-237, 2012-00019 among them) when rc16
      widened ``rkaf:us-frdoc``, the bare-legacy numbers when rc17 gave them a
      space, and the 4,400 X numbers when rc18 did;
    - ``None`` otherwise, which is a refusal and never a repair — including
      for the **five** modern-form numbers a hand-validated collision census
      names as naming two genuinely different documents (REF-066): checked
      FIRST, before any shape is even asked, because minting anything for
      one of these — even the partner hatch — would still be one identifier
      standing for two documents.

    **Five modern-form numbers refuse absolutely, and two mint exactly as
    normal, because they name different things (REF-066).** A 2026-09-02
    full crawl of the published Federal Register found seven modern-form
    document numbers that each carry two different publication dates —
    something the modern space, unlike the legacy space above, was never
    built to expect. Reading the actual documents
    (``research/evidence/fr-collision-census-2026-09-02/``) separated five
    genuine collisions (different agencies, different subjects — an EPA
    notice sharing ``2010-31094`` with an unrelated DOT/FAA rulemaking eleven
    months later, among them) from two that are one matter published twice,
    each explicitly a correction of its own document number ("In notice
    document 2015-17759 … make the following correction"). The five are
    refused outright by
    :func:`~hand_validated_interpretations.is_a_refused_federal_register_collision`,
    consulted before any other check and never hardcoded here: an O(1)
    membership test against that table's own seven rows for the
    overwhelming majority of values that are not one of the seven, and only
    for one that is, the pinned census re-read and that single value's own
    hand-validated row witnessed. Minting an ordinary number therefore
    reaches no census file, no witness and no git — it is a pure function
    of the value in every deployment, which an audit on 2026-09-02 found it
    briefly was not (REF-066). The two mint ``rkaf:us-frdoc`` exactly as any
    other modern number would, because one identifier for one matter
    published twice is correct, not merely tolerated.

    ``column_licensed`` is the whole of the two-readers doctrine in this
    module, delegated whole to
    :func:`~identifier_shapes.is_federal_register_document_number`'s own
    ``column_licensed`` flag — this function adds no second opinion about
    what the column licenses. Unlabeled in running text "94-12345" is
    indistinguishable from a docket or a release number and stays unread;
    arriving from a ``document_number`` field it needs no inference, because
    the field is the license. Nothing about prose detection changes either
    way — the flag admits shapes and admits them nowhere else. See
    :data:`~identifier_shapes.BARE_LEGACY_FEDERAL_REGISTER_DOCUMENT_NUMBER`
    and :data:`~identifier_shapes._FR_COLUMN_LETTER_FORMS`.

    **The year prefix is never checked against the date, and that refusal is
    measured.** A legacy number's leading two digits usually restate its
    publication year, and a fence on the disagreement is the obvious next
    thought — but 1,661 of the 395,498 bare-legacy values (0.42%) genuinely
    disagree, systematic year-boundary spillover where a number issued in late
    December is published in early January (07-6308 on 2008-01-15, 94-* into
    1995, 01-* into 2002). The sibling letter families do the same thing at
    larger scale (E8 spills 318 documents into 2009). So the prefix is a
    spelling, the date is the caller's fact, and this function refuses to
    adjudicate between them: adding that check would silently refuse 1,661
    real documents.

    The padding is never normalized, and after the widening that rule is the
    only thing standing between a document and a second identifier. The Office
    of the Federal Register pads some years and not others; across all 480,566
    modern-form values now inside the space, not one padded number has an
    unpadded twin — measured, and the load-bearing safety proof for widening
    the space at all. So 2012-00019 is the identifier and "2012-19" would be a
    spelling no publisher issued.
