"""Resolve an act-relative citation through the two pinned OLRC sources.

"Clean Air Act section 111" names no code, title or section number. Resolving
it is two joins over a sealed ``usc-act-index-artifact-v1``:

1. **popular name → act.** The Popular Name Tool's names, aliases, and each
   act's Table III key.
2. **act section → U.S.C. section.** Table III's classification of every
   section of that act.

**And a second, independent source with its own coverage.** The U.S. Code's
own source credits state, per section, the act section that added it *and the
division of the enacting public law* — the discriminator Table III lacks,
since Table III is keyed by the public law alone.

The two are **complementary, not a tiebreaker over one another**, and they are
not symmetric. Table III is keyed by ``(law, act section)`` and answers with
*every* row, so its ambiguity must be attacked after the lookup, by a page
range that is sound in one direction only. The credits are keyed by
``(law, division, act section)`` — the discriminator is *in* the key — so
their ambiguity is decided at lookup time and refuses as ``multi_target``.
Their coverage differs by two orders of magnitude: 8,391 Table III keys
against 109 laws in the credits, which is why the credits read as a spot check
rather than a peer. Measured on release point 119-102: of the 222 unambiguous
credit triples whose public law Table III was also fetched for, **176 have no
in-division Table III row at all** — ``26 U.S.C. 6038E`` among them. So
:func:`resolve_act_relative_citation` consults both, records which one
answered, and **refuses when they answer differently**
(:data:`SOURCE_COMPOSITION_RULE`).

Every answer is *derived* from the tables at call time; there is no checked-in
lookup of answers. A refusal is a first-class result: :class:`ActResolution`
always carries either an identifier or an :data:`UNRESOLVED_REASONS` code —
never neither, and never a guess in place of one.

**Read the refusals with the build in mind.** Which build is now a choice.
:data:`USC_ACT_INDEX_PER_PAGE_ARTIFACT` was fetched one HTTP request per act
and holds Table III's classifications for **24** laws against the 8,391 the
popular-name index names, so ``act_section_not_classified`` — much the
commonest code this module publishes — was for 12,695 of its 12,963 cited acts
a statement about a build that requested 27 pages and reached 24, not a
statement OLRC ever made. :data:`USC_ACT_INDEX_BULK_ARTIFACT` — the default,
:data:`USC_ACT_INDEX_ARTIFACT`, since 2026-08-23 — is the same artifact rebuilt from OLRC's
whole-of-Table-III release by :mod:`refspec.registry.usc_act_index`: **15,189**
laws, 302,156 rows, no ``source_incomplete`` at all. Measured over the Unified
Agenda corpus it moves act-relative resolution from 205 (act, section) pairs /
3,621 rows to 354 / 5,590, losing nothing and changing no answer, and turns a
large part of the remaining refusals into codes that are about the source
rather than about coverage — see
``research/evidence/act-index-bulk-table3-2026-08-22.md``. It is one release
point behind (119-73 against 119-102) for the 24 laws both cover, in 29
enumerated rows, which is why switching was taken as a decision rather than
allowed as a consequence -- taken on 2026-08-23, once those 29 rows were
enumerated and none was a resolution this corpus asks for.
``test_act_section_not_classified_is_mostly_never_fetched`` keeps the per-page
number on the record.

Provenance: ported from ``spicy_regs/ontology/act_index.py`` — itself the
evolved successor of the DocSpec-archive original — at its newest state
(division-range discrimination, the two-source composition, and the
sound-half-only range rule all included). The sealed artifacts it reads moved
to this repository's canonical output tree on 2026-08-21 and are digest-pinned
below; the loaders here verify those pins, which the ancestor did not.

#: The sealed artifacts, relative to the repository's output tree, with the

#: carry the acquisition provenance (popularnames.htm digest, coverage
#: counts); these pins are what make a wrong directory fail loudly instead of
#: loading as a source with no coverage. They deliberately restate a number
#: the receipts also carry: reading the pin *from* the receipt beside the

#:
#: Keyed by ARTIFACT, not by table, since 2026-08-22: two act-index artifacts
#: now state the same table names, and a flat table -> digest map cannot hold

#: a sealed directory may be copied anywhere and stay itself — so the digest
#: remains the whole authentication. What that costs is stated rather than
#: papered over: because the two act-index artifacts share one popular-name
#: table byte for byte, no check here can tell a directory holding 08-02's
#: classifications from one holding 08-22's *by that table*, and the
#: classifications and quarantine tables distinguish them and must agree on the
#: admitted artifact; the shared popular-name file fits either one.

#: An alias may point at a name the Popular Name Tool does not itself list:
#: "ERISA" points at "Employee Retirement Income Security Act" and the only
#: entry by that name is "… Act of 1974". The year is how the tool
#: distinguishes acts, so it can only be *supplied*, and only when exactly one
#: act supplies it — "Clean Air Act Amendments" would be 1966, 1970 and 1977,
#: and choosing among them would invent a citation the source never made.
ALIAS_YEAR_RULE = "supply-trailing-year-when-exactly-one-act-supplies-it"

#: **What the tool states outranks what this module derives.** Supplying a
#: year is an inference; a cross-reference is the source speaking, so the whole
#: chain of stated ones is read before any year is supplied. The receipt's own
#: derivation of :data:`ALIAS_YEAR_RULE` scopes it that way — "an ALIAS TARGET
#: missing one may have it supplied" — but the code applied it to the query
#: first, and so contradicted the Popular Name Tool twice in the pinned index:
#:
#: * "Clean Water Act" — the tool says *see Federal Water Pollution Control
#:   Act*; the module answered the *Clean Water Act of 1977*, which is the
#:   amending act, not the act. 943 Unified Agenda authority rows cite it.
#: * "Anti-Kickback Act" — the tool says *see Copeland Anti-Kickback Act*; the
#:   module answered the *Anti-Kickback Act of 1986*.
#:
#: Reading the chain first also stops answering the right act for the wrong
#: reason: "Internal Revenue Code" resolved to the 1939 code only because its
#: year was ambiguous enough to fall through to the tool's stated rename.
#: Where the stated chain leads nowhere the year is still supplied, so the
#: Insurrection Act — whose cross-reference is "Title 10, chapter 13 (Sec. 251
#: et seq.)", a place and not an act name — still answers 1807. Measured over
#: all 13,648 names: those two are the only answers this precedence changes.
ALIAS_PRECEDENCE_RULE = "stated-cross-reference-before-derived-year-v1"

#: How many names one walk may visit before it is abandoned. Termination does
#: not rest on this: the walk stops at the first name it has already visited,
#: and the alias map is finite. It is a declared bound with measured headroom
#: — the longest chain in the pinned index is two hops
#: (``test_the_longest_stated_chain_in_the_pinned_index_is_two_hops``), and the
#: artifact's own receipt records the bound as a rule of the build.
ALIAS_MAX_DEPTH = 8

#: Exclude only when every complete page is outside the conservative division
#: range, regardless of row count. Unknown or narrowed pages cannot prove it;
#: an in-range page does not establish membership. The next start bounds the end.
DIVISION_RULE = "act-division-complete-pages-exclusion-v2"

#: Both sources are consulted, always. Either may answer alone; the same
#: identifier from both says ``both``; different identifiers REFUSE. The
#: measured cause of disagreement is an act section that classified to more
#: than one place, where each source retains a different one — (114-94,
#: div. C, §32101): Table III says 22 U.S.C. 2714a, the credits say
#: 26 U.S.C. 7345, and both are true. Naming one would be arbitrary.
#: Multiple credit targets likewise prevent selecting a lone Table III candidate.
SOURCE_COMPOSITION_RULE = "table3-and-source-credits-plurality-and-disagreement-refuse-v2"

_YEAR_SUFFIX = re.compile(r"\s+of\s+(?:1[789]|20)\d{2}$")

#: A leading article the Popular Name Tool wrote into its own cross-reference
#: text — "see The Vocational Rehabilitation Act" — where its entry for the act
#: carries no article. It is spelling, not identity, and the same expression
#: already exists in ``unified_agenda_parquet._act_prose_recoveries``, applied
#: there to corpus text and never to the tool's own names. Stripping it is
#: tried only after every stated name has been checked verbatim, so the tool's
#: own spelling still wins (:data:`ALIAS_PRECEDENCE_RULE`), and still before a
#: year is supplied, because dropping a word the act's own entry does not use
#: is reading the source and supplying a year is inferring past it. Measured
#: over every name the tool writes: it rescues exactly four —
#: "the vocational rehabilitation act" and "the 911 modernization act", and the
#: two names whose stated chains dead-end at them, "fess-kenyon act" and
#: "improving emergency communications act of 2007".
_LEADING_ARTICLE = re.compile(r"^the\s+")

#: A Table III key that is also a public law number, which is what the source

#: have nothing to be looked up under.
_PUBLIC_LAW_KEY = re.compile(r"^[1-9]\d{0,2}-[1-9]\d*$")

#: The ``rkaf:us-usc`` lexical space, restated **verbatim** from the contract
#: this repository pins. ``rulespec-conformance==0.2.0rc9`` states it
#: identically in all four compiled forms — JSON Schema, SHACL, Rego and
#: TypeScript — as::
#:
#:     ^urn:rkaf:us:usc:[1-9][0-9]*:[1-9][0-9]*[a-z]*(-[0-9a-z]+)*$
#:
#: This module neither widens nor narrows the space on its own: it mints a
#: candidate and checks it, and a target the space cannot spell refuses as
#: ``usc_section_not_expressible``. Restating rather than importing keeps the
#: check readable at the point of use;
#: ``test_the_minted_space_is_the_contract_verbatim`` holds the copy true
#: against the vendored package, the way :data:`_ARTIFACT_PINS` is held true
#: against its receipts. Agreeing with the contract is this module's job;
#: **the contract itself is fallible and ours to fix**, so where it cannot
#: spell something the U.S. Code really has, that is recorded as a gap in rkaf
#: rather than treated as a fact about the section — see
#: ``test_what_the_space_still_cannot_express_is_a_gap_in_rkaf``.
#:
#: Until 2026-08-22 this was a hand-written ``\d+[a-z]?(?:-\d+[a-z]?)?``, which
#: diverged from the contract in BOTH directions. It refused 616 real sections
#: the space permits — 12 U.S.C. 1831aa, 12 U.S.C. 2279aa-11, 42 U.S.C.
#: 2000bb, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-11 — because it allowed one trailing letter and one
#: hyphen group where the contract allows any number of both. And it minted
#: ``urn:rkaf:us:usc:42:0123`` and ``urn:rkaf:us:usc:0:1``, which the contract
#: forbids, because it allowed a leading zero where the contract requires
#: ``[1-9]``. Both are gone.
#:
#: What still refuses on the pinned tables is 1,286 targets that are not a
#: single section: 1,118 statutory NOTES ("42 U.S.C. 1 nt"), 127 POSITIONS
#: ("prec. 2161", a chapter heading's location), 14 RANGES ("79 to 79z-6"),
#: and 27 comma-separated LISTS ("2151w, 2221, 2222, …") that the artifact
#: builder stored in a scalar column. A note and a range are real, citable
#: things rkaf has no production for; the list is a builder defect, not a
#: space defect. None of the four is a section, so refusing each is right —
#: what is wrong is calling all four "not expressible" without saying which.

    under it -- a statement about the source that the source contradicts.

    The split is derivable rather than descriptive, which is why it is here and
    not in a comment. Measured against the pinned index over the 13,648 names
    it reaches -- its 13,626 ``name_key`` values plus the ``see also`` targets
    that appear as nothing else -- these three predicates partition the 107
    unanswerable names **67 / 21 / 19**.

    That is NOT the 63 / 25 / 19 :func:`resolve_act_name` notes, and the four
    names between them are the reason this walks the chain instead of testing
    the asked name alone. ``articles of war`` is a ``see`` row pointing at
    ``uniform code of military justice``, which the source LISTS as a ``cite``
    row and publishes no Table III key for; the reference does not dead-end,
    it lands on a listed act with nothing filed under it. Saying "the trail
    stops" there would be false, and the raw rows say so:
    ``articles for the government of the navy``,
    ``admiralty jurisdiction act (extension`` and
    ``interstate commerce commission dangerous article act`` are the same
    shape. The older counts describe the name SETS; these describe what a
    caller is told, which is what a reason code is for.

    Order matters: a name the source cites is answered by the first branch even
    when it also carries a ``see also``, because "listed here, nothing filed
    under it" is the more specific statement.
