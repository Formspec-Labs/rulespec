"""Extract statutory identifier edges from the OLRC's USLM XML edition of the US Code.

The Office of the Law Revision Counsel publishes the US Code as United States
Legislative Markup, an XML vocabulary in which every citation the editors
recognised is already resolved to a machine identifier: ``<ref href="/us/pl/99/514/s2">``
rather than the prose string "Pub. L. 99-514, Sec. 2".  That is the whole reason
this corpus is worth reading.  Nothing here recognises citations -- the publisher
already did that, in the course of producing an official edict of the US
government, and every edge below is a transcription of an editorial decision
rather than an inference of ours.  A tool that ran a citation *recogniser* over
the same text would be replacing a curated answer with a guess.

That distinction is what makes these edges *asserted* rather than *derived* under
[REF-014](../docs/decisions.md) and the Atlas 3.1 binding: an
``atlas:NativeRelationAssertion`` "preserves a publisher-authored relation
between resources in the same semantic ring", and its endpoints "may belong to
one release or to different releases".  A marked-up ``<ref href>`` is exactly
that.  See ``research/evidence/uslm-reference-edges-2026-08-07/README.md`` for
what this does and does not license.

**Why the edges decompose, and why a single total is a lie.**  The href prefix is
not a formatting detail; it names four populations that answer different
questions, and the programme has already been burned by pooling them.  An
archived project advertises "~109,000 cross-references for Title 26", a figure
that can only be reached by adding amendment credits to genuine cross-references.
They are not the same relation and they do not belong in the same edge set:

* ``/us/pl/…``   -- the section's **amendment history**.  Overwhelmingly these sit
  inside ``<sourceCredit>`` and ``<note topic="amendments">``: they say "Public
  Law 99-514 amended this section", not "this section refers to Public Law
  99-514".  As a graph edge the direction of interest is provenance, not
  reference.  They are ~61% of Title 26's hrefs and they dominate any pooled
  count, which is exactly how a pooled count misleads.
* ``/us/stat/…`` -- the Statutes at Large page the amendment was printed on.  A
  citation *of the same event* as the ``/us/pl`` edge beside it, in a different
  citator.  Counting both as independent references double-counts the amendment.
* ``/us/usc/…`` -- the **section-to-section cross-reference**, and the population
  everyone actually wants.  Where it sits matters more than how many there are:
  corpus-wide the 330,508 split as 175,739 in editorial notes, 64,021 in
  table-of-contents scaffolding, and 90,692 in operative enacted text.  Target
  level is not homogeneous either -- 1,895 address a *subtitle*, 1,548 a chapter --
  so ``uscTargetLevel`` is emitted rather than assumed.

  **Markup density is a per-title property, and Title 26 is its worst case.**
  This is the single most important thing to know before generalising from one
  title.  Across most titles OLRC marks up same-title references heavily: 65-88%
  of operative USC references stay inside their own title, and in Title 42
  marked-up refs outnumber unmarked "section NNN" prose 26,417 to 5,366 (83%
  markup).  Title 26 inverts it -- 1,574 marked against 16,421 unmarked, an 8.7%
  markup share, and of its 539 operative USC references just *six* point at
  Title 26 itself.  So "the enacted text's internal reference network is missing"
  is true of Title 26 and false of the corpus.  A consumer validating on Title 26
  alone would conclude the corpus is unusable for intra-title graphs; one
  validating on Title 42 alone would conclude it is complete.  Both would be
  wrong, which is why per-title context counts are in the manifest rather than a
  single corpus-level rate.
* ``/us/act/…``  -- reference to a named act (``/us/act/1954-08-16/ch736``), used
  where the drafters cited the act rather than its codified location.

**An emitted row is an occurrence, not an edge.**  This is the second way a
pooled total misleads, and it is subtler than the first.  The walk yields one row
per href-bearing element, which is the right unit for *evidence*: it is a
faithful record of where the publisher put each mark-up, and discarding
repetition at extraction time would destroy the ability to audit the transcript
against the source.  But a graph edge is a claim, and the same claim marked up
four times in one section is one claim.  Over the full corpus the two units
differ by more than an order of magnitude in the only place it matters --
1,342,167 occurrence rows contain 87,586 distinct operative section-to-section
references -- so the tool computes both and refuses to let either stand in for
the other.  :data:`ASSERTION_KEY` is the deduplication policy, stated once,
applied here, and reported in the manifest.  See :func:`dedupe`.

**What this tool refuses to do.**  It does not normalise identifiers, resolve
dangling targets, collapse the four types into one, or repair the publisher's
markup.  Two refusals are load-bearing:

*Identifiers are copied byte-for-byte.*  Section numbers in this corpus contain
U+2013 EN DASH, not ASCII hyphen -- ``/us/usc/t26/s1400Z–1`` -- and the ``href``
joins to the corresponding ``<section identifier>`` only if that codepoint
survives.  "Tidying" the dash to ASCII silently severs the join, and a consumer
who did it would see a plausible-looking identifier that matches nothing.

*Dangling targets are kept and flagged, never dropped.*  About 1% of same-title
section references point at sections that no longer exist in this edition,
because the corpus retains the historical citation after a repeal.  Dropping them
would misrepresent the law's own text; silently keeping them would misrepresent
the graph.  They are emitted with ``targetResolved: false``.

**Where an edge sits is part of what it means**, so ``context`` is a first-class
field rather than a filter applied here.  ``sourceCredit`` and the amendment note
topics are the section's history; ``note`` is editorial apparatus; ``toc`` is
navigation the publisher generated; only ``operative`` is enacted text.  The
distinction is not cosmetic -- an earlier revision of this tool folded ``toc``
into ``operative`` and thereby invented 2,992 Title 26 "section-to-section
references" that were really contents-table entries pointing at subtitles, with
no citing section at all.  That every ``operative`` edge has a non-null
``sourceUnit`` is checked on every run, and is what makes that class of error
loud instead of silent.  It is also what caught the appendix titles: the same
check written against ``<section>`` alone failed on Title 5 Appendix, which is
built from reorganization plans rather than sections (see :data:`UNIT_TAGS`).

**Element scope, and why it is not just ``<ref>``.**  Most hrefs sit on a ``<ref>``,
but 42,065 of them -- 3.1% of the corpus, spread over 33 titles -- ride on ``<a>``
instead.  Title 26 has only 8, which is exactly why this is worth stating: judged
on Title 26 alone the difference looks like a rounding error, and a ``<ref>``-only
extractor would appear correct while silently dropping 8,343 edges from Title 49,
4,833 from Title 10 and 4,517 from Title 54.  The pattern is not random.  ``<a>``
appears where the publisher renders a *tabular* note -- overwhelmingly
``topic="historicalAndRevision"``, the revision tables that the positive-law
restated titles carry and Title 26 does not.  Every href-bearing element is
therefore read and its tag recorded, so the choice is visible in the output rather
than baked into a filter.  Conversely ``<ref class="footnoteRef">`` carries no href
at all: it is an internal footnote pointer, not a citation, and is counted as
skipped rather than malformed.

Read-only against the publisher's bytes.  The downloaded zip is hashed and never
rewritten, and the build fails closed on any href whose prefix it does not
already have a meaning for -- an unrecognised citator is a signal that the corpus
grew a relation this tool does not model, which is a reason to stop rather than
to emit a row typed ``unknown``.

#: The fields that distinguish one *claim* from another.
#:
#: An emitted row is a markup occurrence; this key is what makes two occurrences
#: the same edge.  Three choices in it are decisions rather than conveniences,
#: and each was measured against the full corpus before being taken:
#:
#: ``context`` **is in the key.**  This is the one that matters.  Dropping it
#: yields 1,170,595 keys against 1,192,890 with it -- 22,295 triples that the
#: publisher marked up in *two different kinds of text* and that a context-free
#: key silently merges.  Those are precisely the pairs where the same citation
#: appears once in enacted text and once in an editorial note, which is the
#: distinction this entire tool is built to preserve.  A context-free dedup would
#: reintroduce, at the assertion layer, exactly the conflation the ``context``
#: field exists to prevent.  Filter on context first, then deduplicate within it;
#: never the other way round.
#:
#: ``sourceAnchor`` **is the subject, and a null one is not a claim.**  2,641 rows
#: (0.20%) carry no anchor: they sit in a repealed or transferred unit that kept
#: its ``id`` but lost its ``identifier``, so there is no endpoint to hang an edge
#: on.  They are retained in the JSONL as evidence and excluded from the assertion
#: population, counted rather than dropped.  Note that 1,422 of them are in
#: ``operative`` context -- so this is not a rounding error confined to notes.
#:
#: ``noteTopic``, ``element``, ``sourceUnit`` and ``targetResolved`` are **not** in
#: the key.  They are properties of the occurrence or of the target, not of the
#: claim: whether the publisher rendered a reference as ``<ref>`` or ``<a>`` does
#: not make it a different reference.  ``title`` is included although it is
#: recoverable from ``sourceAnchor``, because it makes the key self-describing and
#: keeps per-title accounting exact without a parse.
