# Rulespec Conformance — L0–L4 levels

Status: Editor's Draft, normative.
Companion to: `spec/rkaf-core.md`, `spec/rkaf-vocabulary.md`, `spec/rkaf-behavior.md`.

## 0. Purpose

This document specifies what "Rulespec-conformant" means at increasing depths of integration. Conformance is **consumer-declared and self-certified** — there is no central certification authority pre-1.0. An implementation declares the level it satisfies; the relevant audit or conformance suite is the falsifiability gate.

Five levels are defined:

| Level | What an L`n`-conformant implementation guarantees |
|---|---|
| **L0 — Vocabulary** | A non-JSON-LD carrier maps its fields to registered Rulespec terms, identifier schemes, and closed-enum values. |
| **L1 — Parse** | Documents claiming to be Rulespec parseable as JSON-LD without error. |
| **L2 — Shape** | Every Rulespec node validates against its compiled JSON Schema, including the `x-rkaf-order` and `x-rkaf-not-equal` Rulespec extensions. |
| **L3 — Constraint** | Every Rulespec node also passes SHACL constraints, including Pattern-C cross-property invariants, and all registered semantic-integrity checks. |
| **L4 — Behavior** | Implementation honors the runtime contracts in `spec/rkaf-behavior.md` (reducer, CascadeClosureV1, 10 bridge rules, point-in-time exceptions, stale transition). |

L1 ⊂ L2 ⊂ L3 ⊂ L4 — each JSON-LD level subsumes the prior. L0 is the vocabulary-only path for tabular or other non-JSON-LD carriers; it is not a prerequisite for L1. An L3-conformant implementation MUST also be L2- and L1-conformant.

## 0.1 L0 — Vocabulary [Normative]

### Requirement

An L0 implementation MUST:

1. Publish a carrier-mapping document pinned to the SHA-256 digest of the
   Rulespec contract: the kernel CUE, every domain profile's CUE, the shared
   context, and every L0 range registry.
2. Declare each mapped field's carrier location, subject type, predicate,
   direction, value kind, collection behavior, and class-valued range.
3. Give an executable transform and sample for every IRI-valued field that is
   not a closed enum; a closed-enum IRI-valued field declares an `enum_map`
   instead. Identifier transforms also declare the registered identifier
   scheme.
4. Preserve closed-enum discipline through an explicit `enum_map` or
   executable transform.
5. File a self-certification with `declared_levels: [L0]`,
   `rulespec_version`, `carrier_mapping`, `terms_used`, and
   `test_corpus_version`. `terms_used` MUST be the unique set of full term IRIs
   present in the mapping blocks. A declaration MAY additionally state its
   scope carve-outs machine-legibly with `excluded_terms` and
   `excluded_tables` (see **Scope carve-outs** below).
6. NOT claim L1, L2, L3, L4, or an Appendix-D adoption depth. L0 does not
   exercise a JSON-LD carrier, and Appendix D does not define depth semantics
   for vocabulary-only carriers.

### Carrier-mapping format

The carrier-mapping document MUST contain one or more fenced code blocks whose
info string is exactly `yaml rkaf-l0-mapping`. Each block is a mapping with
exactly `rulespec_version` and `mappings`. `rulespec_version` MUST equal the
current `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` contract digest. Every block in one
document MUST use the same digest.

```yaml rkaf-l0-mapping
rulespec_version: "sha256:8030448aae2cb9eb5457093e1f8ba97320ff2450f6b68b30b17c1aa970a6bbed"
mappings:
  - table: proceedings
    column: current_stage
    subject_type: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#Proceeding
    term: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#proceedingStage
    direction: forward
    value_kind: vocab
    enum_map:
      proposed: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#proceedingProposed
      final: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#proceedingFinal
  - table: proceedings
    column: fr_document_numbers_json
    subject_type: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#Proceeding
    term: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#publishedInProceeding
    direction: inverse
    object_type: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#Artifact
    value_kind: iri
    collection: json-list
    transform:
      template: "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/{value}"
    samples:
      - input:
          fr_document_numbers_json: '["2024-00366"]'
        output:
          - https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-00366
```

The example above maps a US rulemaking carrier, so both of its predicates —
`rkaf:proceedingStage` and `rkaf:publishedInProceeding` — are US rulemaking
PROFILE terms defined by `spec/rkaf-rulemaking.md` and codified under
`constraints/profiles/us-rulemaking/`, not universal kernel terms. L0 places no
adoption obligation on any profile: an implementation maps whichever registered
terms its carrier actually holds, kernel or profile, and the digest in
`rulespec_version` covers the kernel shapes, every profile's shapes, the shared
context, and every L0 range registry.

Each entry has these rules:

- `table`, `subject_type`, `term`, `direction`, and `value_kind` are required.
  `subject_type` and `term` MUST be full registered HTTP(S) IRIs.
- Exactly one of `column` or `columns` is required. `columns` is a non-empty,
  duplicate-free list for transforms that compose several fields.
- One carrier column MAY project multiple distinct predicates or directions.
  Only an exact repeat of table, column set, term, and direction is a duplicate.
- `direction` is `forward` or `inverse`. Forward emits
  `subject --term--> transformed value`. Inverse emits the transformed related
  node as the RDF subject pointing to the carrier subject. `object_type`
  declares that related node's class and is required for inverse mappings and
  class-valued ranges.
- `value_kind` is `iri`, `vocab`, `literal`, `number`, or `date` and MUST match
  the registered context/CUE coercion. `collection` defaults to `scalar`;
  `json-list` parses a single JSON-array column and applies the transform to
  every item as `{value}`.
- `enum_map` is valid only for a closed-enum property, and its `value_kind`
  MUST be `vocab` or `iri`. Both coercions put the value on the wire as an IRI;
  the difference is only whether the context resolves a bare term (`@vocab`) or
  carries the already-expanded IRI (`@id`). Every target MUST be a registered
  value allowed for that property. A closed-enum property registered as `iri`
  — `rkaf:decision`, `rkaf:assertionOrigin` — therefore declares its discipline
  through `enum_map` rather than through a transform, whose output the audit
  checks for IRI shape and never for membership.
- `transform` contains either `template`, or `pattern` plus `replacement`.
  A SCHEME-BEARING identifier predicate also requires `identifier_scheme`.
  EvidenceBindings point to materialized SourceFragment nodes;
  `rkaf:fragmentIdentityScheme` belongs to the fragment and is not an
  edge-level identifier declaration.
- `source_membership`, when present, contains exactly `table` and `column`.
  It is valid only on a one-column mapping. A scalar value, or each item of a
  `json-list`, participates in that mapping only when the exact non-null value
  occurs in the named carrier column. Nonmembers remain preserved in the source
  carrier but MUST NOT be projected through that entry. A corpus-level receipt
  MUST report the projected and excluded counts and MUST fail if a projected
  value lacks the declared membership evidence. This is an evidence filter, not
  permission to discard a value merely because it fails a lexical grammar.
- A transform requires a non-empty `samples` list. Each sample has exactly an
  `input` mapping and expected `output`; the audit executes it and checks the
  declared value kind.

Unknown block, entry, transform, and sample keys are errors. The audit checks
predicate domains and class ranges from the current CUE contract, so an
inverse relationship cannot silently become a forward relationship.
A document MAY contain prose and other code blocks around the mapping blocks.

### X-prefixed Federal Register identifiers [Normative]

`rkaf:us-frdoc-x` registers the lexical space
`^urn:rkaf:us:frdoc-x:X[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{5,7}$`. The published `X` is part of
the identifier and MUST be preserved verbatim. A bare value such as
`09-101207` is not an `rkaf:us-frdoc-x` identifier, and a producer MUST NOT
strip the prefix to force the value into another Federal Register scheme.

Read the digits after the hyphen from the right: the last four are `MMDD`,
and the preceding one to three digits are the variable-width daily sequence.
The two digits after `X` are the publication year's final two digits. The
number is therefore self-dating and takes no external date qualifier. A
producer minting from a catalog row MUST compare the encoded year, month, and
day with `publication_date` and MUST refuse a mismatch as defective source
data, not treat it as an ambiguity.

The upper tail bound is a capacity decision. The pinned Federal Register
corpus contains sequences only through 30, but the seven-digit ceiling allows
sequences through 999 so an unusually busy future day does not strand a real
document. The finite ceiling also fences the lexical space. The scheme covers
all X-prefixed Federal Register documents; `document_type`, not the identifier,
records genre or editorial tier. `spec/rkaf-rulemaking.md` §5.2 gives the
canonical examples and measured population.

### Worked pattern — attestation as a table [Normative]

`spec/rkaf-core.md` §3.1 and §4.7.3 place approval, rejection, and revocation
in an `rkaf:Attestation` **targeting** the record — never in a field on the
record itself. That rule is about the SHAPE OF THE GRAPH, not about the
serialization, and a tabular carrier satisfies it the same way a JSON-LD one
does: with a separate node set whose rows point at the approved records. This
subsection states the pattern normatively so a Parquet, SQL, or CSV producer
does not have to infer it.

An L0 implementation that records approval MUST carry it in a **separate
attestations table**. One row is one `rkaf:Attestation` node. The row's own
identifier is the Attestation's identity; the approved record's identity
appears only in the target column, which maps to `rkaf:targets`. Six columns
carry the required Attestation terms:

| Column role | Term | Value kind | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attestor | `rkaf:attestor` | `iri` | The IRI of the party that decided. |
| Attestor kind | `rkaf:attestorKind` | `vocab` | Closed `rkaf:AttestorKind`; declare it with `enum_map`. |
| Targets | `rkaf:targets` | `iri` | At least one target. A repeated column is a `json-list`; a one-target-per-row table is `scalar`. |
| Decision | `rkaf:decision` | `iri` | Closed `rkaf:AttestationDecision`; declare it with `enum_map`. |
| Scope | `rkaf:attestationScope` | `literal` | What the decision covers. |
| Decided at | `rkaf:attestedAt` | `literal` | `xsd:dateTime`. |

Four rules make the tabular form carry the same meaning as the JSON-LD one:

1. **The attestation is not a column on the approved record.** An
   `approved_by` or `approval_status` column on the assignments, assertions, or
   findings table is NOT an Attestation, whatever it is renamed to. It carries
   no attestor kind, no scope, no decision time, and no revocation, and it
   cannot express two attestors disagreeing about one record. A carrier that
   holds only such a column MUST NOT map it to `rkaf:decision`,
   `rkaf:attestor`, or any other Attestation term.
2. **Rejection is a row.** `rkaf:rejected`, `rkaf:abstained`, and
   `rkaf:flaggedForReview` are values of the same closed decision set as
   `rkaf:approved`. A record with no attestation row is UNREVIEWED; it is not
   rejected. A carrier that represents rejection by deleting the row, or by the
   absence of an approval row, has made rejection unrepresentable and MUST NOT
   claim `rkaf:decision`.
3. **Revocation is a value, not a delete.** A withdrawn attestation keeps its
   row and gains `rkaf:revokedAt`. Deleting the row destroys the record that
   the decision was once made.
4. **`rkaf:targets` is the join, and it is many.** The Attestation names the
   records; the records do not name the Attestation. A target column with a
   single-value constraint is a narrowing of the pattern, not the pattern, and
   an implementation that needs one attestor decision over several records MUST
   either repeat the target column as a `json-list` or emit one row per target
   with a shared attestation identifier.

The mapping below is the worked example. It is audited by
`tools/test_l0_mapping_audit.py`, so it is executable rather than illustrative:

```

`fixtures/attestation-tabular-projection-positive.jsonld` is what two rows of
that table project to: one approval and one rejection over the same
`rkaf:ConceptAssignment`, both carrying their own attestor, scope, and decision
time, and neither appearing as a field on the assignment. The fixture is
validated at L1, L2, and L3 by the repository gates, so the pattern's output is
checked and not merely asserted.

An implementation MAY inline the attestation columns into the record's own
table ONLY when that table carries the full column set above, its rows still
project to separate Attestation nodes with their own identity, and the mapping
still declares `subject_type: rkaf:Attestation` for every attestation column.
Inlining is a storage choice about where the columns sit; it is never
permission to model approval as a property of the approved record, and it
caps the carrier at one attestation per record — a second attestor, a later
revocation, or a rejection following an approval all require the separate
table.

### Worked pattern — universal carrier-local evidence [Normative]

All durable assertions, including ConceptAssignment, use the same inverse
EvidenceBinding path. A tabular carrier materializes one EvidenceBinding row
and one SourceFragment row rather than projecting assignment-specific inline
evidence.

A carrier-local fragment URN may carry the fragment coordinates:

```text
urn:rkaf:fragment:<percent-encoded artifact IRI>:<start>:<end>:sha256-<64 hex>
```

Offsets are Unicode code points over a half-open `[start, end)` interval; the
digest covers the selected text. The SourceFragment declares
`rkaf:carrier-local-fragment`. The EvidenceBinding points to that materialized
node and independently records evidence kind and function:

```yaml rkaf-l0-mapping
rulespec_version: "sha256:8030448aae2cb9eb5457093e1f8ba97320ff2450f6b68b30b17c1aa970a6bbed"
mappings:
  - table: evidence_bindings
    column: assertion_iri
    subject_type: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#EvidenceBinding
    term: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#bindsAssertion
    direction: forward
    value_kind: iri
    transform:
      template: "{assertion_iri}"
    samples:
      - input:
          assertion_iri: urn:rkaf:example:assertion:1
        output: urn:rkaf:example:assertion:1
  - table: evidence_bindings
    column: fragment_iri

        output: urn:rkaf:fragment:urn%3Arkaf%3Aartifact%3A1:0:12:sha256-2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222
    source_membership:
      table: source_fragments
      column: fragment_iri
  - table: evidence_bindings
    column: evidence_role
    subject_type: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#EvidenceBinding
    term: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#evidenceRole
    direction: forward
    value_kind: iri
    enum_map:
      textual: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#textualEvidence
  - table: evidence_bindings
    column: evidentiary_function
    subject_type: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#EvidenceBinding
    term: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#evidentiaryFunction
    direction: forward
    value_kind: vocab
    enum_map:
      supports: https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#supports
```

The carrier MUST also materialize each SourceFragment's `oa:hasSource`,
`oa:hasSelector`, `rkaf:selectorKind`, and
`rkaf:fragmentIdentityScheme`. Percent encoding follows the RFC 3986
unreserved set with uppercase hex triplets. A carrier that publishes ordinary
fragment IRIs declares `rkaf:published-fragment`; a carrier-local URN declares
`rkaf:carrier-local-fragment`.

### Scope carve-outs [Normative]

`terms_used` says what a declaration COVERS. What it deliberately leaves out
used to live in `notes` prose, which no tool reads — so "we do not map concept
assignments this quarter" and "we stopped mapping concept assignments last
quarter" were the same sentence to every gate, and a scope that shrank looked
exactly like a scope that had always been that shape.

Two OPTIONAL keys make a carve-out a checked declaration:

```yaml
excluded_terms:
  - "https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#bindsSourceFragment"
excluded_tables:
  - "attestations"
```

- `excluded_terms`, when present, is a non-empty, duplicate-free list. Every
  entry MUST be a **registered contract term** and MUST NOT appear in
  `terms_used` or in any mapping block. Registration is what stops a carve-out
  naming a predicate the contract never had, which would read as coverage of
  something Rulespec does not define. The not-mapped rule is what stops a
  declaration claiming a term twice, in and out at once.
- `excluded_tables`, when present, is a non-empty, duplicate-free list of
  carrier table names, and MUST NOT name a table any mapping block maps. Tables
  are carrier-local strings, so the audit checks them against the mapping and
  not against the contract.

Both keys are optional and both default to absent, so every declaration written
before they existed keeps passing unchanged. **Absent means the implementation
said nothing about what it left out.** It is NOT the complement of `terms_used`,
and no rule reads it that way — an implementation that wants "everything else is
out of scope" says so in `notes`, because that claim is about the whole contract
and the audit cannot check it.

What the keys buy is a diff. Widening is one term leaving `excluded_terms` and
appearing in `terms_used`; narrowing is the reverse. Each is a single hunk in
review rather than a paragraph nobody re-reads.

### Gate

`tools/l0_mapping_audit.py` parses the fenced blocks and verifies their contract
digest, structure, vocabulary terms, domain/range, direction, value kind,
transforms, samples, and enum targets against the CUE vocabulary, semantic
range registry, and canonical JSON-LD context. Given a partner YAML, it also
resolves `carrier_mapping`, verifies `terms_used`, checks any declared
`excluded_terms` and `excluded_tables` against the registry and the mapping,
and rejects mixed L0/L1+ claims or an L0 adoption-depth claim.

```bash
python3 tools/l0_mapping_audit.py --print-contract-version
python3 tools/l0_mapping_audit.py docs/ontology.md
python3 tools/l0_mapping_audit.py conformance/partners/rulespec-reference.yaml
```

The repository gate invokes the tool without arguments. That mode discovers every L0 declaration under `conformance/partners/`.

### Self-certification

Declaring L0 requires the mapping audit to pass against the published carrier mapping. L1–L4 fixture verdicts are `not-claimed`; they do not determine the L0 result.

## 1. L1 — Parse [Normative]

### 1.1 Requirement

An L1 implementation MUST:

1. Accept any document carrying `@type` values prefixed with `rkaf:` and parse them as JSON-LD 1.1 nodes.
2. Recognize the canonical Rulespec JSON-LD context URL (`https://rulespec.org/context/rkaf-context.jsonld`) and resolve term-to-IRI mappings against it.
3. Round-trip a Rulespec document through JSON-LD expand → compact without loss of `rkaf:*` typed properties.
4. NOT panic, crash, or silently drop nodes on unrecognized `rkaf:*` properties — forward-compatibility requires extension property tolerance.

### 1.2 Gate

`tools/conformance_report.py --level L1 --fixture <path>` exits 0 if the document parses as JSON-LD without error.

### 1.3 Self-certification

Declaring L1 requires that **every fixture under `fixtures/` parses without error** through the implementation's JSON-LD loader.

## 2. L2 — Shape [Normative]

### 2.1 Requirement

An L2 implementation MUST:

1. Satisfy L1.
2. Validate every Rulespec node against the JSON Schema for its `@type` IRI. The canonical schema set is `compiled/json-schema/core/`; the canonical Rust validator is the `rkaf-validate` crate.
3. Refuse to interpret an `@type` outside the v0.2 vocabulary as Rulespec-typed (pass-through is OK; mis-validation is not).
4. Surface validation errors with at least the offending JSON pointer and the violated constraint (`required`, `enum`, `type`, `pattern`).

### 2.2 Gate

`rkaf-validate <file>` exits 0 on L2-conformant input, 1 on any L2 violation. `tools/conformance_report.py --level L2 --fixture <path>` is the Python-side equivalent.

### 2.3 Self-certification

Declaring L2 requires that **every positive fixture validates cleanly** and every embedded JSON Schema type has positive-fixture coverage. Negative fixtures MUST surface at least one L2 or L3 violation across the reference gates.

## 3. L3 — Constraint [Normative]

### 3.1 Requirement

An L3 implementation MUST:

1. Satisfy L2.
2. Validate every Rulespec node against CUE-generated SHACL under
   `compiled/shacl/core/` and the legacy Pattern-C-only suite under `shapes/`.
   A hand-authored shape MUST NOT redefine a CUE-expressible structural,
   lexical, date, or ordered-field constraint.
3. Enforce Pattern-C cross-property and graph invariants — for example,
   `assertionOrigin = aiSuggested` requires AI lineage and a provisional usage
   cap, and every durable assertion requires an inverse EvidenceBinding.
4. Recompute every `rkaf:ReferenceResourceRelease` semantic-manifest digest
   with RDFC-1.0 and SHA-256, reject blank-node release manifests, and reject a
   declared digest that does not match the closed graph defined by
   `spec/rkaf-core.md` §4.1.1. A lexical digest shape does not satisfy this
   requirement.
5. Surface SHACL violations with focus node, result path, source constraint
   component, and result message, and surface semantic-integrity failures with
   the affected release and the expected digest.

### 3.2 Gate

`tools/ci_validate.py` is the Python L3 gate: it runs SHACL and the registered
semantic-integrity checks. `tools/reference_release_digest.py` implements the
RDFC-1.0 release check, and `tools/validate_negatives.py` proves that both a
well-formed wrong digest and a blank-node release fail. An L3-conformant
implementation produces an equivalent verdict on every fixture.

### 3.3 Self-certification

Declaring L3 requires that **every positive fixture passes the full SHACL shape
suite and registered semantic-integrity checks** and **every negative fixture
surfaces at least one L2 or L3 violation** through the reference gates.

## 4. L4 — Behavior [Normative]

### 4.1 Requirement

An L4 implementation MUST:

1. Satisfy L3.
2. Implement the `usageEligibility` reducer per `spec/rkaf-behavior.md` §1, honoring narrow-only / LocalAdoption-broadens-within-scope invariants.
3. Implement `CascadeClosureV1` per `spec/rkaf-behavior.md` §2 — the algorithm name in `LifecycleEvent.cascadeAlgorithm` is the conformance identifier.
4. Honor all 10 bridge contract rules per `spec/rkaf-behavior.md` §3.
5. Honor point-in-time exceptions per §4 — refuse unsupported `evaluationAnchor` values.
6. Implement stale transition per §5.
7. Emit a `rkaf:BridgeValidationResult` for every packet ingest, with conformant `result` / `effectiveUsageEligibility` / `authorityChainStatus`.

### 4.2 Gate

L4 conformance is gated by `crates/rkaf-runtime-cli/src/main.rs` (the `rkaf-behavior-validate` binary). `tools/conformance_report.py` shells out to this binary for every fixture under `fixtures/behavior/`, parses the per-fixture JSON verdict, and populates the L4 column with `pass` / `fail` / `error` / `skip`. Exit 0 from the binary across all behavior fixtures (56 today: 3 cascade — base fanout + all declared cascade predicates + as_of; 9 reducer — baseline workspace, applicability gate, capability cap, local broadens, stale narrows, stale-with-honored-PIT, freshness fresh/stale/malformed; 2 PIT — supported anchor + unsupported anchor; 17 concept-resolution — all seven methods, all three cache states, direct and mapping eligibility failures, and all 4 conflict severities; 25 bridge-rule — positive + negative per all 10 contract rules plus Rule 5 safeAutomaticMigration exemption and targeted-finding/attestation boundary cases) is the L4 verdict gate.

`tools/l4_coverage_audit.py` is the branch-coverage gate. It verifies that the behavior corpus covers all five contracts, all 10 bridge rules with accepted/rejected outcomes, the reducer's normative branches, supported/unsupported PIT handling, concept resolution outcomes plus the severity ladder, every cascade predicate, cascade `as_of`, and Rule 5 safeAutomaticMigration.

When the binary is missing (e.g., the workspace has not been built), the reporter marks affected behavior fixtures `L4: skip` with a clear note and treats the run as divergent. A conformance run that did not execute L4 behavior fixtures is not green.

### 4.3 Self-certification

Declaring L4 requires the implementation to file a `conformance/partners/<implementation>.yaml` document enumerating which behavior-spec sections are implemented and the implementation's plan for the ones not yet enforced.

## 5. Test corpus [Normative]

The conformance test corpus lives under `fixtures/`. The §10.1 coverage target per source spec:

| Coverage | Target | Current |
|---|---|---|
| Per-class positive fixtures | every embedded compiled schema type | 110 positive fixtures; `rkaf-validate` asserts coverage for all 53 embedded `@type` schemas |
| Per-class negative fixtures | every codified class with required fields | 275 negative fixtures; `tools/validate_negatives.py` discovers and gates all of them |
| Per-class edge fixtures | every codified class | 56 edge fixtures; `tools/l0_l3_coverage_audit.py` asserts coverage for all 53 compiled schema classes |
| Behavior fixtures | every L4 contract family and normative branch | 56 behavior fixtures |
| Adversarial fixtures | ≥5 | 6 (in `fixtures/adversarial/`) |
| AI-extraction adversarial fixtures | ≥3 | 3 (in `fixtures/ai-extraction/`) |
| Projector round-trip fixtures | every projector × Attach/Extract | 7 (in `fixtures/projectors/`) |
| Cross-target parity fixtures | every CORE Vocabulary class × {JSON Schema, SHACL} | covered via `tools/constraints_parity.py` |

A class's negative + edge fixtures are housed in `fixtures/negatives/<class>-*.jsonld` and `fixtures/edges/<class>-*.jsonld` respectively to keep the positive set discoverable.

## 6. Self-certification document [Normative]

Implementations declaring a conformance level publish a YAML at `conformance/partners/<implementation>.yaml`. The template at `conformance/self-certification.template.yaml` enumerates the required fields. The common fields are:

```yaml
partner: "<organization or maintainer name>"
implementation: "<package@version>"
rulespec_version: "<commit hash or pre-release tag; L0 uses contract sha256>"
declared_levels: [L1, L2, L3, L4]   # cumulative JSON-LD subset, or [L0] alone
test_corpus_run_at: "<date>"
source_revision: "<exact tested revision, or null for a local uncommitted candidate>"
test_corpus_version: "<immutable fixture/corpus version>"
constraint_contract_digest: "sha256:<exact tested constraint-contract digest>"
results:
  L0: not-claimed
  L1: pass
  L2: pass
  L3: pass
  L4: pass
notes: |
  Free-form. Document what the implementation does and does not enforce.
```

The conformance reporter
(`tools/conformance_report.py --self-certify --source-revision
<40-character-tested-commit> > conformance/partners/<implementation>.yaml`)
produces this document from a committed test run. A local uncommitted candidate
omits `--source-revision` and produces `source_revision: null`.

For an L1–L4 declaration, `source_revision` identifies the exact source
revision tested and `constraint_contract_digest` identifies the generated
constraint contract. A local uncommitted candidate MAY set
`source_revision: null` so that it does not invent an immutable revision. A
self-certification with a null source revision MUST NOT support a published
release or immutable conformance claim. Its final release evidence MUST name
the tested committed revision and reproduce the same contract digest.

An L0 document also includes:

```yaml
declared_levels: [L0]
rulespec_version: "sha256:<current L0 contract digest>"
carrier_mapping: "path/to/the/published-mapping.md"
terms_used:
  - "https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#hasAgendaItemIdentifier"
# Optional, and checked: every excluded term is registered and unmapped,
# every excluded table is unmapped. Absent means nothing was said about
# scope, never "everything else is out".
excluded_terms:
  - "https://rulespec.org/ns/v1#bindsSourceFragment"
excluded_tables:
  - "attestations"
test_corpus_version: "<immutable carrier corpus version>"
results:
  L0: pass
  L1: not-claimed
  L2: not-claimed
  L3: not-claimed
  L4: not-claimed
```

## 7. Why consumer-declared and not authority-certified [Informative]

Pre-1.0 Rulespec is a public substrate, not a credentialed-membership organization. The federation thesis (`spec/rkaf-core.md` §1.3) is structural: partners agree on the substrate, not on a body that certifies their conformance. Self-certification with falsifiability through the conformance suite is the appropriate posture for a federation substrate at this stage.

Post-1.0, a governance shell (per `spec/rkaf-core.md` §13.3) MAY introduce third-party conformance audits, but the suite itself remains the falsifiability gate.

## 8. Adoption depth gradient interaction [Informative]

Conformance level is distinct from adoption depth (D0–D5 per source spec
Appendix D). Appendix D describes integration with the structured Rulespec
substrate and does not define a depth for the L0 vocabulary-only carrier path.
An L0 declaration therefore omits `adoption_depth`. A JSON-LD implementation
may be:

- **L2 at D1** — a partner accepting Rulespec overlays in JSON Schema documents (low integration, basic validation).
- **L3 at D3** — a reference consumer (like Studio) whose schemas are CUE-derived from a Rulespec profile, with full SHACL gate enforcement.
- **L4 at D5** — a substrate-level implementation owning the runtime contracts (workflow engine, governance platform).

For L1–L4, the matrix is multiplicative: an implementation declares a
(level, depth) tuple. JSON-LD consumers often operate at (L2, D1) or (L3, D2);
reference consumers operate at (L3, D3); substrate hosts operate at (L4, D4)
or (L4, D5).
